The '''Alola''' region (Japanese: '''アローラ{{tt|地方|}}''' ''Alola {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. It was the seventh [[core series]] region to be introduced and is the setting of [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Pokémon Sun, Moon]], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon]]. 

Alola is made up of four islands: [[Melemele Island]], [[Akala Island]], [[Ula'ula Island]], and [[Poni Island]]. In the center is an artificial island by the name of [[Aether Paradise]]. It is a popular resort destination and attracts a lot of tourists from other regions. In Alola, humans and [[Pokémon]] coexist in a very close relationship, and a culture has developed that is different from other regions.

The [[island kahuna]] of each island is known to offer the first partner Pokémon to Trainers beginning their journey of this archipelago. In gameplay, the kahuna of Melemele Island, [[Hala]], will offer the options of {{p|Rowlet}}, {{p|Litten}}, and {{p|Popplio}} to beginner Trainers in Sun and Moon, while in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, [[Professor Kukui]] of [[Alola Route 1|Hau'oli City Outskirts]] will offer the same three Pokémon under Hala's behalf.

==Etymology and design concept==
===Etymology===
According to [[Shigeru Ohmori]], the name "Alola" is meant to incorporate a meaning of a land that overflows with life force and supports various forms of life.<ref>[https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo/v/72391082?t=43m Nintendo Treehouse: Live at E3 (recorded)]</ref> Specifically, the name may come from ''ola'' ({{wp|Hawaiian language|Hawaiian}} for life) and the traditional Hawaiian word ''{{wp|aloha}}'', which, beyond its use as a greeting, also signifies a respect and love for the shared life force between all. This etymology is likely also shared by the Alolan greeting and parting "alola". The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Alola is "Alolan", as seen in the term [[Alolan form]].

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Alola|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Alola}}
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world-North America.png|thumb|left|250px|The map of {{wp|North America}} showing the Alola region as the state of {{wp|Hawaii}}.]]
Alola is based on the {{wp|Hawaiian Islands}}, an archipelago in the {{wp|Pacific Ocean}} which is home to {{wp|Hawaii}}, a state of the {{wp|United States}}.<ref>(May 23, 2016). [https://web.archive.org/web/20230618172633/https://lineblog.me/masudajunichi/archives/3406435.html Junichi Masuda's LINE blog] (archived June 18, 2023)</ref> Each of Alola's natural islands is based on one of the Hawaiian Islands:
* [[Melemele Island]] is based on the real-world Hawaiian island {{wp|Oahu|Oʻahu}}.
* [[Akala Island]] is based on the real-world Hawaiian island {{wp|Maui}}.
* [[Ula'ula Island]] is based on the real-world Hawaiian island {{wp|Hawaii (island)|Hawaiʻi (the Big Island)}}.
* [[Poni Island]] is based on the real-world Hawaiian island {{wp|Kauai|Kauaʻi}}.

Each natural island in Alola is associated with a color, which corresponds with the official color designation for their real-world counterparts. Each island is also named after the Hawaiian word for their associated color. The colors also correspond with the [[nectar]] and flowers available on said island, as well as each island's [[guardian deities|guardian deity]].

==History==
===Dated history===
* 500 years prior: {{p|Magearna}} was built by a scientist and presented to a king's daughter.
* 2 years prior: [[Gladion]] steals a [[Gladion's Silvally|Type: Null]] from his [[Lusamine|mother]] and leaves [[Aether Paradise]].
* 3 months prior: [[Lillie]] steals a [[Nebby|Cosmog]] from the [[Aether Foundation]] and during her escape, the Cosmog {{M|teleport|teleported}} her to a beach, where she is found by [[Professor Burnet]]. Since then, she started living with Burnet and her husband [[Professor Kukui|Kukui]].

===Undated history===
*"Hundreds of years ago"
** As the people of [[Ultra Megalopolis]] injured {{ga|Necrozma}} in an attempt to steal its powers, pieces of its prismatic body were rained down onto different universes, which included Alola's, giving origin to the [[Sparkling Stone]]s, [[Z-Crystal]]s, and consequently, to the [[Z-Ring]]s{{sup/7|S}}{{sup/7|M}}/[[Z-Power Ring]]s{{sup/7|US}}{{sup/7|UM}}, and [[Z-Move]]s.
** A Pokémon known as the {{p|Solgaleo}}{{sup/7|SUS}}/{{p|Lunala}}{{sup/7|MUM}} emerged from an [[Ultra Wormhole]]. Seeing them as a threat, the [[guardian deities]] had battled the [[Legendary Pokémon]] but were defeated in the end. Solgaleo{{sup/7|SUS}}/Lunala{{sup/7|MUM}} then offered the tapu the [[Tapunium Z]] as a reward for their efforts. Afterwards, the Legendary Pokémon, along with it's counterpart, a Lunala{{sup/7|S}}{{sup/7|US}}/Solgaleo{{sup/7|M}}{{sup/7|UM}}, eventually created a newborn in the form of a {{p|Cosmog}} for the tapu to take care of. This has created a repeated cycle found in the region.
** Necrozma, arrives in Alola through an Ultra Wormhole, stealing all of the light in the region and shrouding it in darkness. During the events it gets a hold of Solgaleo{{sup/7|US}}/Lunala{{sup/7|UM}} and turns into Dusk Mane Necrozma{{sup/7|US}}/Dawn Wings Necrozma{{sup/7|UM}}. Under the commands of Alola's royalty, the four tapu battled the now dubbed "{{ga|Necrozma|pillager of light}}" to retrieve the region's light. With the help of a youth using a Sparkling Stone and [[Z-Power]], the group had managed to defeat and banish Necrozma, restoring the region's light and freeing Solgaleo{{sup/7|US}}/Lunala{{sup/7|UM}} from it. This had created Alola's tradition of the [[island challenge]]. All books related to Necrozma were burned.
** The [[Battle Royal]] was created based on battles between the four [[Guardian deities|tapu]].
** [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] are seen to have existed for hundreds of years.<ref>[[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]] takes place an undocumented number of years before any other title in the franchise. Within said title, [[Professor Laventon]] claims, ''"Remarkable! Truly outstanding stuff! A Pokémon letting someone ride on it... Why, it's just like the [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] of Alola!"''  Implying the service had existed prior to Legends: Arceus.</ref>
* A [[Thrifty Megamart]] was built on {{p|Tapu Bulu}}'s sacred grounds, however, this angered the guardian deity, that destroyed the [[Tapu Village|village]] and the megamart itself, leaving the [[Pokémon Center]] as the only functioning building.
* A group that coalesced around one of the [[Island kahuna|islands's kahunas]] provoked the wrath of the four island deities and in return, was struck down by them, the surviving members became the first members of [[Team Skull]].
* A few years prior to the events of the game, professor [[Mohn]] of the [[Aether Foundation]] had conducted research on [[Ultra Beast]]s and discovered the existence of the [[Ultra Wormhole]]s, {{p|Cosmog}}, and the UB-01: {{p|Nihilego}}, however, he vanished during a mission to connect to an Ultra Wormhole, leaving only a weakened [[Nebby|Cosmog]] behind.
* Somehow, Mohn returned to Alola after losing his memories and started working at the [[Poké Pelago]].
* The Aether Foundation started the [[beast killer project]] and created the [[Pokémon category|Synthetic Pokémon]] Type: Full based on myths and legends involving a [[Arceus (Pokémon)|Mythical Pokémon]]. However, the project was a failure due to the three Type: Full models rejected the {{A|RKS System}} and went berserk. In response to it, [[Faba]] put a control mask on all three models and placed them cryogenic stasis for eternity, renaming species as {{P|Type: Null}}.

===Contemporary history===
The worlds of Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon take place in different universes from one another, with the worlds of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon taking place in universes different from not only each other but to Sun and Moon as well, causing a set of [[Pokémon multiverse|parallel universes]]. Pokémon Moon and Ultra Moon have a 12 hour [[time]] difference from Sun and Ultra Sun. Alola's contemporary history is different in Sun and Moon compared to Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

====Pokémon Sun and Moon====
{{ga|Elio}}/{{ga|Selene}} begins their [[Pokémon journey|adventure]] after meeting Professor Kukui who takes them to receive their first partner Pokémon from [[Island kahuna|Kahuna]] [[Hala]]. During this series of events, the trainer meets Lillie, mistaking her for the kahuna; her Cosmog; [[Nebby]], and Hala's Grandson, [[Hau]] on their way to [[Iki Town]]. Nebby gets attacked by wild {{p|Spearow}} on a wooden bridge, to which is destroyed after thet help protect the Pokémon. Melemele's island guardian, {{p|Tapu Koko}}, saves the two of them and offers Elio/Selene a [[Sparkling Stone]]. They receive their first partner Pokémon and a [[Z-Ring]] at the festival inaugurating their [[island challenge]], consisting of seven trials and four grand trials in order to become the island challenge champion. Along their journey, they encounter a group called [[Team Skull]], whose members are misfits who failed the island challenge and aim to cause trouble, as well as the Aether Foundation, whose goal is to cure hurt Pokémon. Midway through their island challenge, Elio/Selene are brought on a tour of Aether Paradise, where they find a {{p|Nihilego}}, an [[Ultra Beast]] and are tasked to defeat it. After defeating the leader of Team Skull, [[Guzma]], at the [[Shady House]], they learn that Lillie was taken away by Team Skull, and upon Gladion's request, him, Elio/Selene, and Hau travel to Aether Paradise to rescue Lillie, where they battle [[Lusamine]], the president of the Aether Foundation who is also revealed to be Lillie and Gladion's mother. Lusamine opens [[Ultra Wormhole]]s across Alola and enters one with Guzma. Elio/Selene and Lillie evolve [[Nebby]] into {{p|Solgaleo}}{{sup/7|S}}/{{p|Lunala}}{{sup/7|M}} at the [[Altar of the Sunne]]{{sup/7|S}}/[[Altar of the Moone]]{{sup/7|M}} and travel into [[Ultra Deep Sea|Ultra Space]], where Elio/Selene battle Lusamine once again and brings her and Guzma back to Alola. They catch Nebby after Lillie tells it that she isn't a Trainer. The trainer then climbs to the summit of [[Mount Lanakila]], where the newly opened {{al|Pokémon League}} stands. They defeat the [[Elite Four]] and Professor Kukui, becoming the first {{pkmn|Champion}} of Alola. A festival is held in Iki Town, and Lillie brings them to the [[Ruins of Conflict]] to thank {{p|Tapu Koko}}. 

The next day, Lillie leaves on boat for Kanto to help her sickly mother. The [[International Police]] contact Elio/Selene to investigate and catch the Ultra Beasts unleashed across Alola.

====Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon====
{{ga|Elio}}/{{ga|Selene}} begins their [[Pokémon journey|adventure]] after meeting [[Professor Kukui]] who provides them with their first partner Pokémon on [[Island kahuna|Kahuna]] [[Hala]]'s behalf. During this series of events, Elio/Selene meets Lillie, mistaking her for the kahuna; her Cosmog; [[Nebby]], and Hala's Grandson, [[Hau]] on their way to [[Iki Town]]. Nebby gets attacked by wild {{p|Spearow}} on a wooden bridge, to which is destroyed after they helps protect the Pokémon. Melemele's island guardian, {{p|Tapu Koko}}, saves the two of them and offers Elio/Selene a [[Sparkling Stone]]. They receive a [[Z-Power Ring]] at the festival inaugurating their [[island challenge]], consisting of eight trials and four grand trials in order to become the island challenge champion. Once again they come across [[Team Skull]] and the Aether Foundation, battling a wild {{p|Nihilego}} found on Aether Paradise. However, they're also met with a new group known as the [[Ultra Recon Squad]], who are associated with Aether. After defeating the leader of Team Skull, [[Guzma]], at the [[Shady House]], they learn that Lillie was taken away by Team Skull, and upon Gladion's request, him, Elio/Selene and Hau travel to Aether Paradise to rescue Lillie, where they battle [[Lusamine]], the president of the Aether Foundation who is also revealed to be Lillie and Gladion's mother. Lusamine opens a single [[Ultra Wormhole]] to enter with Guzma in a plot to stop {{ga|Necrozma}} from stealing Alola's light. Elio/Selene and Lillie evolve Nebby into {{p|Solgaleo}}{{sup/7|US}}/{{p|Lunala}}{{sup/7|UM}} at the [[Altar of the Sunne]]{{sup/7|US}}/[[Altar of the Moone]]{{sup/7|UM}} however, before they can go into [[Ultra Space]], Lusamine and Guzma are immediately ejected from an Ultra Wormhole, being defeated by Necrozma. Necrozma soon follows and captures Nebby and takes control of its body, becoming Dusk Mane{{sup/7|US}}/Dawn Wings Necrozma{{sup/7|UM}}, and proceeds to not only summon [[Ultra Beast]]s into Alola, but steals all of Alola's light. With help from the Ultra Recon Squad, they [[Ultra Warp Ride|ride atop]] a Lunala{{sup/7|US}}/Solgaleo{{sup/7|UM}} and goes to [[Ultra Megalopolis]] to chase down Necrozma, who then uses the light it took from Nebby to [[Ultra Burst|become Ultra Necrozma]], its original [[form]]. Elio/Selene successfully defeat Necrozma and separate Nebby from it, returning the light to Alola. They then finish their island challenge and climb [[Mount Lanakila]] where they defeat Hau, as their final obstacle and becoming the first {{pkmn|Champion}} of Alola. A festival is held in [[Iki Town]]. Gladion leaves for Kanto and [[Johto]] by boat. They then return home, where they are contacted by Hau and the Ultra Recon Squad to catch {{p|Blacephalon}}{{sup/7|US}} or {{p|Stakataka}}{{sup/7|UM}}. 

=====Episode RR=====
They soon learn of [[Team Rainbow Rocket]], who take over the [[Festival Plaza]] and Aether Paradise. Lillie reaches out to Elio/Selene for help and they intervene, dealing with several [[Team Rainbow Rocket Grunt (Trainer class)|Rainbow Rocket Grunt]]s in the altered Aether Paradise, now known as [[Team Rocket's Castle]]. The organization is ran by several  villainous Team Leaders from previous video games: [[Archie]], [[Maxie]], [[Cyrus]], [[Lysandre]], and [[Ghetsis]]; all coming from timelines where they were successful in their plans. Finally, they reach Lusamine's chamber and defeat Rainbow Rocket's head leader, [[Giovanni]], who then leaves Paradise and restores it to normal after his defeat. However, before he leaves, he subtly implies he has yet more plans in mind. Gladion returns a month later after Giovanni's defeat, allowing him and his mother to reunite with his father in unexpected ways.

==Geography==
===Environment===
[[File:Alola anime.png|thumb|350px|Alola's main islands in {{aniseries|SM}}]]
[[File:Aether Paradise anime.png|thumb|250px|Aether Paradise in {{aniseries|SM}}]]
The Alola region consists of four main islands: [[Melemele Island]], [[Akala Island]], [[Ula'ula Island]], and [[Poni Island]]. It also includes one artificial island, [[Aether Paradise]], described as a "{{wp|very large floating structure}}" or VLFS, and [[Poké Pelago]], a group of small, uninhabited islands. People can travel between the islands via boat, the [[Poké Ride]]'s {{p|Charizard}} Glide, and [[Mantine Surf]]; it is not possible to use the Poke Ride's {{p|Lapras}} Paddle or {{p|Sharpedo}} Jet, or any [[Field move|field moves]], to move between the islands. All four natural islands are, to an extent, forested and mountainous. Most of these islands' cities and towns are on the coast, with the notable exceptions of [[Iki Town]] and [[Paniola Town]]. Routes are relatively developed here compared to other regions, with several of them having their own [[Pokémon Center]]s in addition to residential buildings.

Though steeped in nature, Melemele Island, in the northwest of the archipelago, has the least extreme environments. It is home to Alola's largest settlement, [[Hau'oli City]]. Its routes gently slope up towards the center of the island to form a gradual mountain, on top of which are the [[Ruins of Conflict]]. A notable Melemele Island landmark is [[Ten Carat Hill]], which was formed out of an underwater volcano and has an open-air hollow in the middle, itself resembling a volcano.

Akala Island, in the northeast of the archipelago, contains Alola's only active volcano, in [[Wela Volcano Park]]. It also has the most settlements of the four natural islands. Its largest city, [[Heahea City]], boasts several huge resort hotels, such as the [[Hano Grand Resort]], which has its own beach and golf course. A notable Akala Island landmark is [[Brooklet Hill]], which has cascading waterfalls that give off the impression of a terrace field. The island is also contains a rainforest known as Lush Jungle.

Ula'ula Island, in the southeast of the archipelago, is the largest of Alola's islands. It is also the most varied in terms of weather and terrain, with significantly rougher terrain areas than other islands. For such a large island, it has few settlements: [[Malie City]], the largest city in Ula'ula; [[Tapu Village]], destroyed by the {{p|Tapu Bulu|tapu}} a long time ago, contains just a [[Pokémon Center]]; and [[Po Town]], occupied by [[Team Skull]]. These settlements all sit in the shadow of a contiguous mountain range in the heart of the island, which includes three mountain peaks and a [[Haina Desert|harsh desert]]. On the southwest coast of the island is a large lagoon with [[breakable rock]]s that the Poké Ride's Sharpedo Jet can break through. Notable Ula'ula Island landmarks are the [[Lake of the Moone]] and the [[Lake of the Sunne]], both perfectly circular lakes that have special connections to the [[Legendary Pokémon]] of Alola, {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}.

Poni Island, in the southwest of the archipelago, is the most sparsely populated of Alola's islands. It only contains one settlement in [[Ancient Poni Path]], however the [[Seafolk Village]] is a gathering location of seafarring people. Similar to the [[Battle Zone]] in [[Sinnoh]], it is full of rugged and harsh environments. Though its coasts are fairly flat, the island is mostly mountainous and rocky, in part due to the sprawling [[Vast Poni Canyon]] — described as a natural [[Island challenge|trial site]] — that takes up over half the island's land. Exeggutor Island, a smaller unihabited island that was once its own trial site, can be accessed in Seafolk Village. 

Aether Paradise, just west of the center of the archipelago, starkly contrasts with the natural islands. It is strikingly modern, with a huge building in the center that serves as both the main area and the headquarters of its owners, the [[Aether Foundation]]. Behind this building is a sprawling mansion that serves as the office and residence of its head, [[Lusamine]].

Among Alola's four islands is another smaller archipelago known as [[Poké Pelago]]. This archipelago is uninhabited by people, despite this, [[Mohn]] has made it a paradise for Trainer-owned Pokémon and has several different islands and attractions for their Pokémon to take part in.

===Climate===
Alola has a warmer climate than other regions, being more tropical, similar to its [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Alola|real-world counterpart]] of {{wp|Hawaii|Hawaii}}. For example, a [[Lush Jungle|thriving rainforest]] grows on [[Akala Island]]. The Pokémon themselves have also adapted to Alola's tropical atmosphere, the biggest example being the {{p|Exeggutor}} that grow on Poni Island, who have reached lengths other Exeggutor are unable to reach, due to the amount of sun that shines over the islands. These Exeggutor match the flora that grow on the islands. However, [[Mount Lanakila]], Alola's highest point, constantly experiences snow and {{weather|hail}} due to its high altitude. 

Each of the natural islands also experiences a wide variety of weather conditions. For example, [[Ula'ula Island]] hosts environments with harsh {{weather|sun}}, extreme {{weather|sandstorm}}s, and frequent {{weather|rain}}, in addition to the snow and hail on [[Mount Lanakila]]. [[Exeggutor Island]] is known to have common rain showers, as well, these often result in either rainbows during the day, or meteor showers during the night when the rain clears.

===Ecology===
[[File:Vulpix anime.png|thumb|300px|Due to their snowy habitat, Alolan {{p|Vulpix}} (right) have become {{type|Ice}}.]]
The ecology of Alola is described as being diverse. While plenty of the Pokémon who live in Alola has lived with human natives for generations, plenty of new Pokémon from other regions have shown up recently as well.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161119224622/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/alola-region/ Pokémon Sun and Moon official website (archive)]</ref> Alola's environmental conditions affect its Pokémon in various ways. To adapt to the unique environmental pressures of their Alolan habitats, a number of Pokémon species originally found in the [[Kanto]] region have developed [[regional form]]s named [[Alolan form]]s. Alolan {{p|Exeggutor}}, for instance, are five times as tall as those in other regions due to Alola's abundant sunlight, and Alolan {{p|Vulpix}}, which moved to snowy mountain peaks to avoid the normal habitats of other Pokémon, adapted to their new environment by becoming {{type|Ice}}. In adition to this, some Pokémon are known to only live on individual islands, due to each island's subclimates. This has also affected some Pokémon, such as {{p|Oricorio}}, who are known to change their form depending on the type of [[nectar]] and flora present on the island its found in. [[Vast Poni Canyon]], [[Blush Mountain]], [[Lush Jungle]] and [[Mount Lanakila]] are locations which can induce certain Pokémon to [[Evolution|evolve]].

What has added to this diversity is also the inclusion of Pokémon being brought over from other regions, however this had lead to the issue of multiple {{wp|invasive species}}, such as Alolan {{p|Rattata}} and {{p|Gumshoos}}. The rare phenomena known as [[Ultra Wormhole|Ultra Wormholes]] infrequently appear throughout Alola, causing a disruption of non-native Pokémon known as [[Ultra Beast|Ultra Beasts]] to appear, harming the peace and wildlife. These wormholes, which link to other [[Dimension|dimensions]], are known to pour [[Z-Power]] into the region, which has allowed some Pokémon to enlarge in size and creating the [[Totem Pokémon]] found at trial sites.

Alola is also known to be rather lush in greenery, being rich in vegatation and flora. Have multiple tropically diverse trees and flowers, with each island having different types of plants not found in the others. For example, the flowers that Oricorio use for food come in colors correspnding to the island's name; with Mememele Island containing a [[Melemele Meadow|meadow]] with yellow flowers. While each island has its own plants, they share many similarties too, with many [[Berry tree|Berry Trees]] used for harvesting berries being found. [[Alola Route 2|Route 2]] in particular even has a [[Berry fields (Alola)|Berry field]]. These Berry Trees often drop different types of berries, to which Pokémon like Crabrawler feed from.

Poké Pelago has ecology that differs from Alola's main four islands, but is still environmentally tropical. Here, [[Poké Bean|Poké Beans]] naturally grow, and can be given to Pokémon as a form of delicacy. Wild Pokémon are known to appear on these islands, being attracted to the Poké Beans and Berries that may grow on the islands. Similarly, Exeggutor Island appears to be environmentally different based on version, in Sun and Moon; it appears to be more dry and earthy, matching mainland Poni Island; while in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, Exeggutor Island is much more lush and green, filled with plant life. It is also unihabited by people.

===Demographics===
The Alola region has a total population of 1005{{sup/7|USUM}}, including all towns, cities, and other areas. Since its introduction in [[Generation VII]], it has been the second largest region by population.

===Notable locations===
Alola has nine cities and towns, a big avenue and a [[Pokémon League (Alola)|Pokémon League]]. Like in [[Unova]] and [[Kalos]], the routes of Alola start counting again from 1, likely to represent its geographical isolation from the original four regions. There are 17 routes in total, although there are many other locations in the form of a route that in this region are named differently, such as [[Akala Outskirts]] or [[Poni Grove]].

==Alola League==
{{main|Alola League}}
A {{al|Pokémon League}} for the Alola region was developed on top of [[Mount Lanakila]] by [[Professor Kukui]] only recently. As a result, the Alola League has no [[Pokémon Champion]]. Instead, in Sun and Moon, after defeating the Elite Four, the {{player}} must battle Kukui, the founder of the League, in order to formally attain the title of Alola's first [[Pokémon League]] Champion. In Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the player battles their [[rival]] [[Hau]] instead. The player, as the reigning Champion, can subsequently [[Pokémon League (Alola)/Title Defense|defend their title]] against a variety of challengers.

===Elite Four===

|}

==Trivia==
* Alola is the only [[core series]] [[region]]:
** To have the {{player}}'s home not be located in a city or town. Instead, it is located on {{rt|1|Alola}}.
** To have an [[Elite Four]] member change within a single [[generation]].
** Whose name is a {{wp|palindrome}}.
** To have more than one {{cat|Burial grounds|burial ground}} at once.
* Alola is the only core series region to not introduce any notable {{type|Ice}} [[type expert|expert]].
** However, [[Sina]], who comes from [[Kalos]], being introduced in {{g|X and Y}}, is revealed to be an Ice-type expert when the player meets her in Alola.
* Alola is the first core series region taking place in the modern day not featuring:
** [[Gym Leader]]s, [[Gym]]s, and [[Badge]]s.
** A Pokémon League {{pkmn|Champion}} that precedes the player.
** A [[diploma]] received from someone upon completing the [[Pokédex]].
** [[HM]]s and [[field move]]s.
** [[Cuttable plant]]s.
** [[Roaming Pokémon]].
* Alola is the least visited core series region in ''[[Pokémon Journeys: The Series]]'', only being visited in three episodes.

The '''Galar''' region (Japanese: '''ガラル{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Galar {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]], and the eighth [[core series]] region to be introduced. It is the setting of {{g|Sword and Shield}}.

==Etymology and design concept==
===Etymology===
Galar may have been derived from ''gallant'', ''gala'' (a special occasion), or ''{{wp|Galahad}}''. It may also come from an anagram of ''San-Graal'', the French name of the {{wp|Holy Grail}}. Another possible etymology may be ''galar'', Irish and Scottish Gaelic for "disease," in reference to either [[Dynamax]] and {{p|Eternatus}} or one of Britain's nicknames, Blighty.

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Galar|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Galar}}
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world-Europe.png|thumb|left|250px|The map of Europe showing the Galar region as {{wp|Great Britain}}.]]
Galar is based on the {{wp|United Kingdom}}. According to [[Shigeru Ohmori]], the UK is chosen as a basis for Galar to tie into {{g|Sword and Shield}}'s theme of "strength", and the idea of aiming to be the greatest or the strongest.<ref>[https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/we-interview-junichi-masuda-and-shigeru-ohmori-about-pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield/ We Interview Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori about ''Pokémon Sword'' and ''Pokémon Shield'' | Pokemon.com]</ref>

The main part of Galar focuses heavily on the island of Great Britain, especially {{wp|England}} and (to a lesser extent) {{wp|Wales}}. However, the orientation of the landmass is rotated 180° compared to real-world Great Britain: for example, northern Galar is based on southern England. The parts of Galar introduced in the [[Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass]] are based on other parts of the UK: the [[Isle of Armor]] is based on the {{wp|Isle of Man}}, a self-governing {{wp|Crown Dependencies|crown dependency}} of the United Kingdom, and the [[Crown Tundra]] is based on {{wp|Scotland}}.<ref>[https://twitter.com/pokemonnewsuk/status/1216731889920368643 Tweet regarding Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra's inspiration]</ref>

==History==
===Dated history===
* 20,000 years prior to the events of {{g|Sword and Shield}}, a meteorite containing {{p|Eternatus}} fell in Galar.
* c. 3,000 years prior to the events of Pokémon Sword and Shield, Eternatus awakened and created a black storm called the [[Darkest Day]] across Galar, but it was stopped by [[Ancient Galarian kings|two youths]] and the [[legendary heroes]], resulting in the boys being crowned as the kings of the region.
* 50 years prior to the events of Pokémon Sword and Shield, [[Mustard]] defeated [[Opal]] and went on to become Galar's {{pkmn|Champion}}.
* 32 years prior to the events of Pokémon Sword and Shield, Mustard loses his position as Galar's Champion. After retiring from the Pokémon League and traveling the world, Mustard returned to Galar, bought an island, named it the [[Isle of Armor]], and founded the [[Master Dojo]].

===Contemporary history===
====Sword and Shield====
{{ga|Victor}}/{{ga|Gloria}} and their best friend, [[Hop]], receive their [[first partner Pokémon]] from [[Leon]], the undefeated {{pkmn|Champion}} and Hop's brother. Shortly thereafter, they meet a mysterious {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the [[Slumbering Weald]]. As they begin their {{pkmn|journey}}, they receive [[Pokédex]]es from [[Sonia]], [[Dynamax Band]]s from [[Professor Magnolia]], and [[endorsement]]s from Leon to enter the [[Galar League|Gym Challenge]]. They travel across Galar, challenging [[Gym]]s to earn the eight [[Badge]]s they need to enter the Champion Cup. Over the course of their journey, they encounter a group called [[Team Yell]], whose members support [[Marnie]] in the Gym Challenge. They also encounter another group called [[Macro Cosmos]], a conglomerate led by [[Rose]], who has endorsed his ward [[Bede]] in the Gym Challenge. During the Champion Cup in [[Wyndon Stadium]], Rose interrupts the Championship Match by reawakening {{p|Eternatus}}, bringing about the [[Darkest Day]] in an attempt to provide energy for Galar for 1,000 years. To stop Rose's plan, Victor/Gloria and Hop search for the [[Rusted Sword]] and [[Rusted Shield]] in the Slumbering Weald, and with those [[item]]s in hand, they head to the [[Energy Plant]] in [[Hammerlocke]] to face Rose. Victor/Gloria battles and defeats Rose, then joins Leon and Hop to face Eternatus; in the course of the battle, the Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield summon {{p|Zacian}} and {{p|Zamazenta}} (respectively) to their aid. After defeating Eternatus, Victor/Gloria manages to catch it. They then return to [[Wyndon]] to defeat Leon in the Championship Match, becoming the new Champion of Galar.

After becoming Champion, Hop and Victor/Gloria travel back to the Slumbering Weald to return the Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield. While there, they encounter an odd pair of brothers, [[Sordward]] and [[Shielbert]], who proclaim themselves descendants of the original kings of Galar and steal the Rusted Sword and Rusted Shield. The brothers seek to undermine Zacian and Zamazenta's reputation as saviors of Galar by turning them instead into threats. As an experiment to further their plan, they release Dynamax particles across Galar, sending multiple Dynamax Pokémon out of control across multiple stadiums. Victor/Gloria, Hop, and then-former [[Gym Leader]] [[Piers]] set out to stop the rampaging Pokémon, while Sonia tracks the brothers. The group finds them at the Hammerlocke Energy Plant, where they attempt to use Dynamax particles to send Zamazenta{{sup/8|Sw}}/Zacian{{sup/8|Sh}} into an uncontrollable fury. Zamazenta{{sup/8|Sw}}/Zacian{{sup/8|Sh}} resists, instead attacking Shielbert{{sup/8|Sw}}/Sordward{{sup/8|Sh}}. With the help of Hop and Zacian{{sup/8|Sw}}/Zamazenta{{sup/8|Sh}}, Victor/Gloria successfully calms Zamazenta{{sup/8|Sw}}/Zacian{{sup/8|Sh}}. Zamazenta{{sup/8|Sw}}/Zacian{{sup/8|Sh}} then flees, pursued by Hop, while Zacian{{sup/8|Sw}}/Zamazenta{{sup/8|Sh}} allows Victor/Gloria to catch them by defeating them in battle. Victor/Gloria and their new Pokémon return to find Hop in the Slumbering Weald. There, Hop successfully calms and catches Zamazenta/Zacian, and challenges Victor/Gloria to one final battle.

===== The Isle of Armor =====
In [[The Isle of Armor]], Victor/Gloria travels to the [[Isle of Armor]] off the coast of Galar and becomes an apprentice in the local [[Master Dojo]], a [[battle facility]] run by former Champion [[Mustard]]. They also develop a new [[rival]]ry with a Gym Leader-in-training and fellow apprentice named [[Klara]]{{sup/8|Sw}}/[[Avery]]{{sup/8|Sh}}. Victor/Gloria enrolls and takes part in a series of trials, first chasing a trio of fast Galarian {{p|Slowpoke}}, searching for Max Mushrooms, and having a final showdown with Klara/Avery. In doing so, Victor/Gloria proves to be Mustard's best student since [[Leon]], as claimed by Mustard himself. As a reward for completing Mustard's trials, they are given a {{p|Kubfu}} as a companion to raise, with the goal of raising it into a great {{p|Urshifu}}. After developing a strong bond with {{p|Kubfu}}, Victor/Gloria heads to the [[Tower of Darkness]] or the [[Tower of Waters]], and completes a rite of passage to ultimately earn the right to evolve Kubfu into Urshifu. After Victor/Gloria become Champion of Galar, they are tasked by Mustard to find [[Max Honey]] for Urshifu to achieve [[Gigantamax]] transformation, and work alongside Hop to find it. Once Urshifu has achieved the ability to Gigantamax, Victor/Gloria have a final showdown with Mustard, who now holds nothing back, and prevails. Mustard congratulates them, and tells them to be ready for [[Galarian Star Tournament|what's to come]].

===== The Crown Tundra =====
In [[The Crown Tundra]], Victor/Gloria travels to the [[Crown Tundra]] in southern Galar, where they meet [[Peony]], an enthusiastic former {{type|Steel}} Gym Leader and Champion as well as the younger brother of [[Rose]], and take his daughter [[Peonia]]'s place in his explorations of solving the legends lurking around the Tundra, since Peonia refuses to do so. As such, Peony assigns Victor/Gloria as the leader of his "expedition team" and tasks them with searching for various [[Legendary Pokémon]] who are known to reside in the Crown Tundra. One of these Pokémon is the King of Bountiful Harvests, a known figurehead in the Crown Tundra and its small town of [[Freezington]], but one whose stories are now only known to a few. Victor/Gloria eventually meets this Pokémon after restoring its statue, who reveals its name to be {{p|Calyrex}}, while it uses [[Peony]] as a means to communicate with them. It reveals that it had lost its power over the years as less and less people believed in it, and it eventually lost the ability to bring bountiful harvests. Calyrex tasks Victor/Gloria with creating the Reins of Unity (which Peony successfully creates) and planting either an Iceroot Carrot or Shaderoot Carrot in hopes of reclaiming its long lost steed, who is later revealed to be {{p|Glastrier}}/{{p|Spectrier}}. They eventually lure the steed into the Crown Shrine, and Calyrex takes its Reins of Unity and bonds with Glastrier or Spectrier once more, achieving its full power again. Now having regained its power, Calyrex allows Victor/Gloria to challenge it to a battle to catch it, and they succeed in doing so. Calyrex thanks the player and looks forward to the journeys they will share.

In the midst of doing so, Victor/Gloria explores the entirety of the Crown Tundra, discovering several ruins that uncover the [[legendary giants]], including two newly discovered ones in {{p|Regieleki}} and {{p|Regidrago}}. They also discover a tree where [[Galarian form]]s of the [[legendary birds]] come, and chases them all around Galar, one in the Crown Tundra itself, one in the Isle of Armor, and one in Galar's own Wild Area.

In doing all this, Victor/Gloria eventually reports these back to Peony, and eventually they go all the way to the [[Max Lair]] and rejoin Peonia, in which they all partake in [[Dynamax Adventure]]s. In the midst of these, it is revealed a strange Pokémon appeared in the Max Lair and multiple [[Ultra Beast]]s came as well: eventually, Victor/Gloria discover that it was in fact {{p|Necrozma}}, and reports it to Peony, which is then noticed by the scientist running the [[Max Lair]].

After having explored the [[Crown Tundra]], Victor/Gloria receives a call from [[Leon]], who formally invites them to the [[Galarian Star Tournament]] in Wyndon, which involves two-on-two [[Multi Battle]]s, and Victor/Gloria partners with either Hop or Marnie in a series of battles against all of Galar's Gym Leaders and emerges victorious.

==Geography==
[[File:Galar Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Galar in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
The Galar region is an expansive region, including varied environments such as idyllic countrysides, contemporary cities, and snow-covered mountains. Galar comprises a long mainland area as well as an outlying island area, the [[Isle of Armor]], east of the mainland.

The extreme south of the Galarian mainland includes the [[Crown Tundra]]. This area is isolated from the rest of the mainland by a tall mountain range, which extends north along both mainland coasts. However, the Galarian train system allows for travel through these mountains.

Just north of the southern mountains, in the broad valley between its coastal spurs, lie the dense [[Slumbering Weald]] and nearby village of [[Postwick]]. This valley also marks the beginning of a long stretch of plains dotted with hills, ending just north of [[Hammerlocke]], that cover the majority of mainland Galar. These plains are home to two of the three main cities in Galar: Hammerlocke and [[Motostoke]]. Various arid, rocky environments sit at the northern edges of the plains, including the cliffs outside [[Stow-on-Side]] on {{rt|6|Galar}} and the ruins south of [[Circhester]] on {{rt|8|Galar}}. In northwest Galar, surrounding [[Ballonlea]], is the [[Glimwood Tangle]], a thick, gloomy forest. East of this forest lies a broad tundra that includes the city of Circhester and a range of snowy and jagged mountains that separates the metropolis of [[Wyndon]] from the rest of Galar.

The Isle of Armor sits in the sea to the east, closest to the mainland town of [[Spikemuth]]. Much of the isle consists of lush forests, caves, rolling hills and tree-filled valleys that rise from its long beaches. Despite being an island, it is connected to mainland Galar's train system with dedicated [[Flying Taxi]]s.

In the {{pkmn|animated series}}, it was revealed Galar is far enough away from Kanto (and presumably Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh) to require airplanes for travel between them. Dialogue in [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|the games]] reveals that Galar is within swimming distance of Kalos.

===Demographics===
The Galar region has a total population of 727, including all towns, cities, and other areas. Upon its introduction in [[Generation VIII]], it became the {{tt|fifth|While Sinnoh has a lower population than Galar in Diamond and Pearl, it has a higher population in Platinum.}} largest region by population.

===Notable locations===
Galar has 12 cities and towns. Like in [[Unova]], [[Kalos]], and [[Alola]], Galarian route numbers start from 1, likely due to the geographical isolation of these regions from both the original four regions and each other. There are 10 routes in total, all on the Galarian mainland, divided into four groups:
* {{rt|1|Galar}} & {{rt|2|Galar}} in southern Galar, around [[Wedgehurst]] and surrounding locations;
* {{rt|3|Galar}}, {{rt|4|Galar}}, & {{rt|5|Galar}} in central Galar, forming a loop between [[Motostoke]] and the nearby towns;
* {{rt|6|Galar}}, {{rt|7|Galar}}, {{rt|8|Galar}}, & {{rt|9|Galar}} in central Galar, around [[Hammerlocke]] and the nearby towns; and
* {{rt|10|Galar}} in northern Galar, connecting to the southern gates of [[Wyndon]].
Unlike in most other regions, it is impossible to travel through Galar using just these routes. Instead, a train system connects different cities and towns, and thus connects the different sets of routes.

The Galar region also has an extensive area called the [[Wild Area]] which adjoins several towns and cities in the region.

* Between [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]], the two version-exclusive [[Gym]]s show up in different colors on the map. After the release of [[The Isle of Armor]], an extra set of train tracks and a train station were added to the main part of the Galar map. After the release of [[The Crown Tundra]], an additional set of train tracks was added. These train tracks appear even if the player has not purchased the [[Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass]].

==Galar League==
{{main|Galar League}}
The Galar League is the regional [[Pokémon League]] of the Galar region. Trainers who have received a letter of [[endorsement]] may compete in the Gym Challenge. After obtaining the eight [[Badge]]s of the region, a Trainer may participate in the annual Champion Cup at [[Wyndon Stadium]].

==Trivia==
* Galar is the only [[core series]] [[region]] to:
** Not have a [[Pokémon academy]].
** Not have an [[Elite Four]].
*** A similar role is fulfilled by the Champion Cup.
** Contain a single landmass with a map that does not fit on the screen. Previous regions with multiple maps either [[Kanto|contained]] or [[Alola|were]] archipelagos.
** Introduce four [[fossil]]s, the most of any region so far.
*** Despite this, the region does not beat the record for most Fossil Pokémon introduced (five in [[Kanto]]) due to the Galarian Fossil Pokémon being unable to evolve.
** Have two [[Gym Leader]]s resign from their posts over the course of a single game's plot.
* Galar is the first region to:
** Contain no settlements that end in "City" or "Town" in their English names.
** Have a {{type|Dark}} Gym.
** Not have a [[Victory Road]].
** To introduce Fossil Pokémon that are not {{type|Rock}}, incapable of {{pkmn|breeding}}, and do not have genders.
** Introduce no [[Mythical Pokémon]] at the time of its release.
** Not have a [[series]] of {{aniseries|PTS}} solely dedicated to [[Ash Ketchum]] fully exploring the region in a journey.
* In keeping with the sports theme of the region's Gyms, the names of the cities and towns in Galar are derived from sports terminology.
* Galar has the second fewest numbered [[route]]s of any core series region, with a total of ten. [[Paldea]] has none at all.
* Galar is tied with [[Unova]] as the region that has the most [[Gym Leader]]s, with a total of 14.
* In {{aniseries|JN}}, Galar is often depicted with a cloudy, gray sky, similar to the common weather of the country it's based on, the {{wp|United Kingdom}}.
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Galar is "Galarian", as seen in the term "[[Galarian form]]".

The '''Hisui''' region (Japanese: '''ヒスイ{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Hisui {{tt|region|chihō}}'') refers to [[Sinnoh]] as it was known during its discovery and settlement, in a historical period set prior to [[Generation IV]]. It is the setting of {{g|Legends: Arceus}}.

==Etymology and design concept==
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world.png|thumb|left|200px|The map of Japan showing the Sinnoh (Hisui) region as the island of {{wp|Hokkaido}}.]]
===Etymology===
Hisui may be derived from 翡翠 ''hisui'' ({{wp|jade}}) or 秘邃 ''hisui'' (hidden and profound), the latter of which matches [[Sinnoh]]'s name origin.

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Sinnoh|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Sinnoh}}
Hisui may be based on the Japanese island of {{wp|Hokkaido}} while it was still known as Ezo, referring to its inhabitants prior to the {{wp|Meiji Restoration}}. In 1869, the northern frontier was renamed to its current administrative title, which translates to ''northern sea circuit''.
{{left clear}}

==History==
{{main|Sinnoh#History|Sinnoh → History}}
===Dated history===
* One or two millennia prior to the events of {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, the [[Celestica people]] lived in Hisui. They worshiped {{P|Dialga}}, {{P|Palkia}}, {{P|Giratina}}, and {{Ga|Arceus}}, the latter being known as the "almighty Sinnoh".
* Two years prior to the events of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the [[Galaxy Team|Galaxy Expedition Team]] would arrive in the region, consisting of people from numerous various regions. These settlers built [[Jubilife Village]] in Hisui's southwestern corner.  Unlike the two clans that lived in Hisui prior, the people of Jubilife Village were distrusting of Pokémon, so to capture and store them, the expedition team brought with them [[Poké Ball]]s, a newly-invented technology.

===Undated history===
* According to a [[Sinnoh myths|myth]], humans started habitating the region since its creation.
* According to a legend, an [[ancient hero|unnamed hero]] started a journey to gather all 18 {{Ga|Arceus}} [[Plate]]s, befriending ten Pokémon in during his travels. After gathering them all, the hero to met the "almighty Sinnoh" itself, gaining its respect and being blessed by alongside his Pokémon. These ten Pokémon would eventually have descendants that'd be known as Hisui's first {{pkmn2|Noble}} and {{hi|Ride Pokémon}}.
* At some point after the hero's journey, the Celestica people would build the [[Temple of Sinnoh]] atop [[Mount Coronet]] and by extension, the statues of the hero's ten Pokémon.
* The [[Diamond Clan|Diamond]] and [[Pearl Clan]]s would arrive in the region from across the sea and started worshiped a deity known as "almighty Sinnoh", with the Diamond Clan claiming it {{p|Dialga|created time}} and the Pearl Clan claiming it {{p|Palkia|created space}}. This disagreement set off a long-running feud between the two clans. Members of the clans also came to venerate the Noble and Ride Pokémon and appointed themselves as [[warden]]s to tend to their needs.

===Contemporary history===
{{spoilers}}
A space-time rift appeared above [[Mount Coronet]], and causes several [[space-time distortion|distortions]] and storms. Lighting from the rift had struck the four Noble Pokémon that the two clans take care for. During this time, a strange visitor had fallen from the sky. This character, serving as the {{player}} in Legends: Arceus, is found by Professor Laventon at Jubilife's {{DL|Jubilife Village|Prelude Beach}}, and is offered to work for the Galaxy Team after they have shown Laventon their skill. After given some test by the player's [[friend]], known as either {{ga|Rei}} or {{ga|Akari}}, Captain [[Cyllene]] of the Survey Corps appoints them as part of the team followed by Laventon providing them a [[first partner Pokémon]].

The Diamond and Pearl Clans are immediate to go to the Galaxy Team after their Noble Pokémon have caused destruction to both themselves and the land of Hisui. The player character is then appointed to investigate the problems with these four Pokémon and quell their rage, on top of completing Hisui's first Pokédex. As they progress, the player teaches the people of Jubilife Village about Pokémon and companionship, as well allowing the Diamond and Pearl Clans to get along with not only each other, but with ideas from the Galaxy Team as well. The player quells all five Noble Pokémon, but soon, the sky turns red and the space-time distortions worsen, causing [[Kamado]] the Galaxy Team's leader, to distrust the player in assumption they were a part of the cause. The player is kicked out from the team and is no longer allowed within Jubilife Village, seeking help from either clan, who are unable to provide assistance. [[Volo]], a character who the player has met before, assists the player in their time of need and brings them to [[Cogita]], telling them to seek the [[Lake guardian]]s and form a [[Red Chain]]. [[Adaman]] and [[Irida]], the {{tc|Clan Leader}}s, assist the player in their journey to avoid any ill intentions with the Galaxy Team or their clans. They return to the [[Temple of Sinnoh]] that rests upon the top of Mount Coronet. After gaining the trust of the Galaxy team again, the player summons either {{p|Dialga}} or {{p|Palkia}} and gains their respect. The [[Legendary Pokémon]] warns their respective Clan leader about their counterpart, who immediately appears from a portal, in their Origin Forme. The raging counterpart destroys any remains of the Red Chain and the Temple of Sinnoh. The Clan Leaders, Professor Laventon, Rei/Akari and the player then set out to create a special Poké Ball, made of left over pieces of the Red Chain and [[Origin Ore]] and use it to quell the raging counterpart at the Temple of Sinnoh.

After their success, the player continues their attempt at finishing Hisui's Pokédex, where they are stopped by Volo who's in a search for the remaining Plates, on their search, many runes and scripts are left by the Celestica people, with a story similar to that of player. Given to the player by Hisui's Noble and Ride Pokémon, the remaining Plates are held by Hisui's other Legendary Pokémon. In success with capture, the player and Volo meet at Mount Coronet, and are told of a banished Pokémon who served as a third counterpart to Dialga and Palkia. At the now destroyed Temple of Sinnoh, who Volo claims look like [[Spear Pillar|spears sticking out of the ground]], the player is found with conflict against the Pokémon wielder, betraying their trust in hopes to meet Arceus. {{p|Giratina}} is summoned by Volo after defeat and explains that it was cause of the space-time distortions had that appeared throughout Hisui, angering the Nobles and causing previous Origin Forme to go berserk. Once defeated, Volo claims he will continue to find Arceus for as long as it may take.

Hisui's first Pokédex is completed and the player returns to the Temple of Sinnoh, now with an [[Azure Flute]] in hand and summons Arceus at the [[Hall of Origin]]. Arceus gifts the player a piece of themselves, acting as the {{p|Arceus}} species and the final Pokémon in the Pokédex.

After the events of the main story, smaller events known [[Massive mass outbreak]]s start occurring throughout the region during rainstorms. The Galaxy Team and clans begin researching these odd phenomenon. 

Between this time and the modern day, Hisui will become to be known as the [[Sinnoh]] region. The Galaxy Team plans to disband after their objectives have been met, though Cyllene intends to make sure the team's name is [[Team Galactic|passed on]].

==Geography==
[[File:Hisui.png|thumb|250px|In-game map of the Hisui region<br>Hisui is made up of five different sub-regions, each with its own sub-climate]]
===Environment===
{{main|Sinnoh#Environment|Sinnoh → Environment}}
The Hisui region, much like its modern day counterpart of [[Sinnoh]], features a variety of terrains, whether it be rocky mountains, moist swamps or vast oceans, many of Sinnoh's visuals and weather are retained. Hisui's environment is much more abrasive and harsh, and due its more recent settlement, there is very little man-made activity with only one village and two other settlements. Activity is sprawling with more Pokémon than in the future, with many of them acting hostile.

Also like Sinnoh, Hisui is a large region that can be split up, usually between an Eastern and a Western half with [[Mount Coronet]] at its center. The location and environment will change the cloak that {{p|Burmy}} wears, and determine the form of {{p|Shellos}} and {{p|Gastrodon}} that are found. Unlike Sinnoh, the region is also split further than just the two halves, containing five separate sub-regions, often split into their own smaller environments. These sub-regions include: the [[Obsidian Fieldlands]], the [[Crimson Mirelands]], the [[Cobalt Coastlands]], the [[Coronet Highlands]] and the [[Alabaster Icelands]].

The Obsidian Fieldlands is the least hostile of the five sub-regions. The location, as its name suggests, features grassy plains with flower patches and forests that are surrounded by beaches and mountains at its ends. The Obsidian Fieldlands is located in the southwest of Sinnoh which would eventually become [[Sandgem Town]] and {{rt|201|Sinnoh}}. The Obsidian Fieldlands is flat enough to [[Ride Pokémon (Hisui)|ride]] {{p|Wyrdeer}} across the location. The fieldlands' meadows and terrain are split up between two rivers that lead from the north and into the south, ending into the ocean of [[Sandgem Flats]] and [[Ramanas Island]]. The more one follows the paths leading southeast, they'll be met with several hills in the center of location, and further more wooded areas containing [[The Heartwood]]. On the opposite side in the southwest is body of water known as [[Lake Verity]].

The Crimson Mirelands, the location that would eventually become modern day [[Pastoria City]], the [[Great Marsh]] and [[Solaceon Town]], is entirely filled with swamps and rivers, and as its name suggest, plenty of red mud and soil. It is located in the southeastern end of the region. It has multiple ruins and inscriptions such as the [[Solaceon Ruins]]. [[Fog]] is often present in this the Mirelands. While still grassy, it is much more hilly and steep compared to that of the Obsidian Fieldlands. The swampy terrain of the Crimson Mirelands allows for peat to be found. The [[Diamond Settlement]] sit on the Northern end of the Crimson Mirelands, with [[Lake Valor]] resting beside it.

The Eastern side of Hisui are the beaches of the Cobalt Coastlands. These beaches would eventually become the Eastern side of Sinnoh, including [[Sunnyshore City]] and [[Valor Lakefront]]. These beaches are often rocky, and will require a way to get from one side to another such as the use of a {{p|Basculegion}} to ride on. Shaped like a crescent, the lowerhalf of the location reaches out to the east with a hand-shaped beach known as [[Sand's Reach]]. The location has several boxes and washed up trash from old cargo ships, allowing for Burmy to change into its Plant Cloak. On the upper half, divided by [[Veilstone Cape]], is the [[Spring Path]] containing Hisui's fourth lake and [[Turnback Cave]]. The Cobalt Coastlands features volcanic activity in the form of [[Firespit Island]], which much be traveled to by water.

The core of Hisui is the Coronet Highlands with its most defining features being the tall and rocky Coronet Mountain range with [[Mount Coronet]] at its heart. The highlands reaches high altitudes with very little roads, requiring the need of a Pokémon such as {{p|Sneasler}} to traverse its rocky slopes. The mountain range, and not limited to Mount Coronet or peaks, has a [[special magnetic field]] that allows for Pokémon such as {{p|Nosepass}} to evolve. The mountains contain several pools of water, with one such spring, the [[Fabled Spring]], to be where {{p|Clefairy}} gather under a full moon. Inside the mountain range are numerous caves and tunnels, including [[Wayward Cave]]. Multiple [[ruins]] from the Celestica People are found the higher one travels, ending at the snowy summit of Mount Coronet where the [[Temple of Sinnoh]] lies.

The most northern part of Hisui is the Alabaster Icelands. Like its modern day counterpart of {{rt|216|sinnoh}}, {{rt|217|sinnoh}} and [[Snowpoint City]], it is covered in snow. Like many parts of the region, the icelands are also incredibly rocky and mountainous, these rocky formations are often covered in thick-slippery ice that even Sneasler cannot climb. This is especially true in the southern ends of the location that connects to rocky locations of the Coronet Highlands, which like it, has some caves and tunnels. The Alabaster Icelands is mostly barren, but still contains vegetation and tall trees, as well as a river. There is multiple hot springs that one can visit. Many of these springs are found at the [[Pearl Settlement]] that rests at the cliffs below [[Snowpoint Temple]]. Above these cliffs is also [[Lake Acuity]], containing a waterfall that leads to the river.

===Climate===
{{main|Sinnoh#Climate|Sinnoh → Climate}}
Hisui's climate contains many elements from its modern day, but also contains many differences from what one would otherwise expect. The Pokémon are not the only thing that is harsh, but as is the region's climate.

Each sub-region has its own sub-climate, with Hisui's going through its own seasonal changes. These changes are usually accompanied by the [[forces of nature]]. Like Sinnoh, the region is colder in temperature taking place farther north than other locations, allowing for people to dress more appropriately in bundled clothing. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, the weather typically typically changes all on its own and random intervals. Each sub-region has its own sub-climate, with the Obsidian Fieldlands and Coronet Highlands having mostly clear skies; the Crimson Mirelands typically being more moist and damp, the Cobalt Coastlands often has rain showers and the Alabaster Icelands is known to have strong winds and snow. These weather conditions are not exclusive to the individual locations (aside from snow), but are more common amongst them.

In Daybreak, a short game patch story in Legends: Arceus, four of the five sub-regions will have harsh rainstorms that causes {{DL|Mass outbreak|Pokémon Legends: Arceus|massive mass outbreaks}} to occur. In the Alabaster Icelands, where rain doesn't occur, strong snow storms are present instead.

Hisui is unique among other locations, in that it is known to carry [[space-time distortion]]s when a space-time rift occurs over the head of Mount Coronet. These disturbances can appear throughout the entire region, and brings Pokémon, items and even people from alternate timelines or realities. Space-time distortions, along with the space-time rift, can create abnormal lightning, and other weather conditions may occur.

===Ecology===
[[File:Legends Arceus ecology.png|thumb|300x300px|Ecological study of the [[Cobalt Coastlands]]]]
Hisui's harsh environment and climate is much different from most regions of the modern day, leading to many Pokémon being uniquely found within the region as well. Many of which are also not found in the modern-day Sinnoh as well, implying that many of the Pokémon found in Hisui to have gone either extinct or migrate out of the region by the time the events of {{g|Diamond and Pearl}} happen. For example, {{p|Wyrdeer}} are a species of Pokémon evolving from {{p|Stantler}}, a species that still exists in the modern day, but is not found in any of Sinnoh's Pokédexes, and its entry in the [[Paldea]] Pokédex for [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Violet]] specifically state that it used to evolve, implying that Wyrdeer had gone fully extinct. While the {{p|Qwilfish}} and by extension its evolution {{p|Overqwil}} in Hisui are known to have migrated to other colder climates instead, according to the Pokédex at [[Blueberry Academy]] and  White-Striped {{p|Basculin}} and {{p|Basculegion}} can be found in [[Kitakami]]'s [[Timeless Woods]] in the present day. In the case of {{p|Ursaluna}}, it is implied to be at the brink of extinction in the present day, with only [[Timeless Woods#Special encounters|one specimen]] known as the Bloodmoon Beast (that has a form called Bloodmoon Ursaluna) being confirmed to exist, with it being found in [[Kitakami]]'s Timeless Woods. This particular Ursaluna is very old, having used to live in the Hisui region a long time ago until it drifted across the seas and arrived at [[Kitakami]], where it made residence in the land's Timeless Woods. It also gained special powers due to adapting to the hard environment of Kitakami. Hisui's conditions have brought forth many [[evolution]]s and [[regional form]]s that are not found else where in the world. Many of these changes are related to Hisui's seasonal and colder climates, having the Pokémon adapt to new forms. Laventon's study of {{p|Decidueye}} confirms that environment can be an influence on evolution, with the Pokémon in particular having to adapt to the cold. The regional forms first discovered in the Hisui region are described as [[Hisuian form]]s. Hisui is known to have Pokémon appear within [[outbreak]]s, having certain species appear in swarms and groups, appearing more frequently then they would usually.

[[Professor Laventon]] of the Galaxy Team is a [[Pokémon professor]] who studies the ecology of Pokémon, and is tasked by the Survey Corps to create Hisui's first [[Pokédex]].

Hisui's vegetation is also an important part of the ecosystem and to the people and Pokémon who live there, with many plants growing only in Hisui and in no other locations. Similar to regional forms, Hisui also grows a unique type of [[Apricorn]] that other regions such as [[Johto]] and [[Galar]] may not, including [[Apricorn (item)|Brown Apricorn]]s. The many plants that can be used for food that grow in Hisui include [[Sand Radish]]es, [[Sootfoot Root]]s and many types of [[Berries]]. Many of the vegetation in the region is determined by sub-region, for example, [[Pop Pod]]s are a sea vegetable that grow only in the Cobalt Coastlands, while Sand Radishes will only grow in the Alabaster Icelands.

Among usage in food and delicacy, the natural elements found in the region are also used for [[crafting]], an important part of survival in the region. The usage of items are often used to to make other foods, but also items such as [[Poké Ball]]s, and [[Potion]]s. Balms for [[Noble Pokémon]] are often made with ingredients found from around the location that the normal variants of that species would prefer, such as Lord {{p|Electrode}} preferring food made from [[Crunchy Salt]]. This salt often grows in Hisui's mountain tops where Hisuian Electrode tend to live. Many materials are also harvested from the Pokémon themselves, especially plant-like or [[Poison (type)|Poison]]-Type Pokémon such as {{p|Petilil}}, whose leaves are used for medical care, and {{p|Croagunk}}, whose toxins could be used for similar purposes. [[Medicinal Leek]]s are a common vegetable found through out the entire region, and are also used for basic medical purposes and healing. These herbs are often mixed into Potions, but can also be applied directly.

===Demographics===
{{incomplete|section|reason=is 111 accurate?}}
Hisui has a total population of 111 people split up between the [[Galaxy Team]], the [[Diamond Clan]] and the [[Pearl Clan]], having the shortest population of people to date compared to other regions' introductions, as a result of Hisui being recently established. Many of the people originate from different regions from all over the world, including: [[Hoenn]], [[Alola]] and [[Galar]]. The [[Celestica people]], an ancient tribe of Hisuians, had originally lived in the region before dying out. [[Cogita]] and [[Volo]] are stated to be related to the Celestica people or other ancient tribes described as the ancient Sinnoh people.

==Trivia==
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Hisui is "Hisuian", as seen in the term [[Hisuian form|Hisuian Form]].
* During the post-game of {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, [[Kamado]] muses that Hisui could be called the Sinnoh region after the deities the Diamond and Pearl Clans worship, alluding to the region's present-day name.
* Aside from the Coronet Highlands, the names of the four main areas of Hisui correspond to the colors associated with the {{wp|Four Symbols|Chinese Four Symbols}}: the {{wp|Black Tortoise}} of the North (Obsidian Fieldlands), the {{wp|Vermilion Bird}} of the South (Crimson Mirelands), the {{wp|Azure Dragon}} of the East (Cobalt Coastlands), and the {{wp|White Tiger (mythology)|White Tiger}} of the West (Alabaster Icelands). The locations for two of the main areas even correspond to the cardinal directions the Four Symbols represent: the Crimson Mirelands is located roughly in the south or southeast of Hisui, and the Cobalt Coastlands is located in the east of Hisui. The [[forces of nature]] will also start roaming each of the four areas on certain weather conditions, after the player receives the [[Task#Requests|request]] "Incarnate Forces of Hisui".

The '''Hoenn''' region (Japanese: '''ホウエン{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Hoenn {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. It is located south of [[Sinnoh]],<ref>As stated in ''[[AG187|The Unbeatable Lightness of Seeing!]]''.</ref> and southwest of both [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]].<ref>''[[Pokémon Fan (US)|Pokémon Fan]]: 10th Anniversary News Booklet'', p. 16 ([https://archive.org/details/10-anni-book/ Archive])</ref> It is the setting of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions|Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire]], {{v2|Emerald}}, [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire]]. It was the third [[core series]] region to be introduced.

Hoenn is inspired by the real-world Japanese main island of {{wp|Kyushu}}. The names of most of the cities in Hoenn are made of two words put together ("Little Root", "Fort Tree", "Slate Port", "Ever Grande", etc.) rather than colors or plants as [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]] had done. [[Professor Birch]] of [[Littleroot Town]] offers the [[first partner Pokémon]] known as {{p|Treecko}}, {{p|Torchic}}, or {{p|Mudkip}} to {{pkmn|Trainer}}s beginning their journey of this vast land.

==Etymology and design concept==
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world.png|thumb|left|200px|The map of Japan showing the Hoenn region as {{wp|Kyushu}}.]]
===Etymology===
[[Junichi Masuda]] has stated that Hoenn's name signifies "abundant relations" (豊縁 ''hōen''), as a common theme in this region is the relationships forged between Pokémon and people.<ref name=masuda>HIDDEN POWER of masuda, No. 15 [http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir/2004/09/index.html (Japanese)] / [http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/2004/09/index.html (English)]</ref>

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Hoenn|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Hoenn}}
The Hoenn region is based on the real-world Japanese main island of {{wp|Kyushu}}, rotated 90° counterclockwise. Junichi Masuda stated that the reason Kyushu was rotated 90° to create Hoenn was to increase playability.<ref name=masuda/> According to the [[Pokémon Omega Ruby & Pokémon Alpha Sapphire: Super Music Collection]], Masuda further clarifies that this choice was related to the horizontal display of the new [[Game Boy Advance]] screen.<ref>[https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1504100422688153605]</ref>

==History==
===Dated history===
* 2,000 years prior to the events of {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}: 
** The region is plagued by meteor showers, which turns the homeplace of the [[Draconid people]] into [[Meteor Falls]].
** Overflowed with natural energy, [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Groudon}} and Primal {{p|Kyogre}} awakened and fought over it. They ravaged the earth and were only defeated and put to slumber by {{p|Rayquaza}} after the Draconids summoned it through a wish on a meteor. The people of Hoenn then began to revere Rayquaza as their savior.
* 1,000 years prior to the events of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire: 
** The former king of [[Kalos]], [[AZ]] travelled to Hoenn and planted a tree in front of the [[Cave of Origin]]'s entrace.
** A primal energy-filled meteor struck the region, creating a gigantic crater where [[Sootopolis City]] will be built in. Groudon and Kyogre reawakened to fight over primal energy once again. The people of Hoenn wished on Rayquaza to save them once again, and using using a [[meteorite]], Rayquaza performed the world's first [[Mega Evolution]], defeated the two, took away their Primal states, and forced them back to sleep. Afterwards, the [[Sky Pillar]] was built in Rayquaza's honor and the Draconids promised to pass down the prophecy that in 1,000 years the meteor would return
* 40 years prior to the events of {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, {{p|Lunatone}} is discovered at the site of a meteor strike.

===Undated history===
* At the beginning of the [[Pokémon world]]:
** [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Kyogre}} and Primal {{p|Groudon}} are formed by the natural energy in the region and then proceed to fill the sea and create land, respectively. A chance meeting turns the two into rivals, and a conflict for dominance over the Pokémon world begins. This battle continues until {{p|Rayquaza}} quells it, causing Kyogre and Groudon to retreat to special caverns, where they rest in for years. 
** The [[Red Orb|Red]] and [[Blue Orb]]s are created to prevent the reawakening of Kyogre and Groudon, and are left at [[Mt. Pyre]] for safekeeping.

===Contemporary history===
{{ga|Brendan}}/{{ga|May}} moved to [[Littleroot Town]] in Hoenn from [[Johto]]. May/Brendan encountered May/Brendan, competing with Brendan/May to complete the Pokédex. Brendan/May saved [[Professor Birch]] from a Poochyena{{sup/3|RS}}{{sup/6|ORAS}}/Zigzagoon{{sup/3|E}} with a {{p|Torchic}}, {{p|Mudkip}}, or {{p|Treecko}} from Professor Birch's bag; as a reward for saving him, he gave Brendan/May a [[Pokédex]] and allowed them to keep the Pokémon that they used to save him. Brendan/May traveled across Hoenn, occasionally encountering and defeating [[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]]. Team Magma{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|OR}} and/or Team Aqua{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} successfully awakened {{p|Groudon}}{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|OR}} and/or {{p|Kyogre}}{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}}, which caused the region of Hoenn to be plagued by {{weather|harsh sunlight}}{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}}, {{weather|heavy rain}}{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/6|AS}} or a strange mixture of both{{sup/3|E}}. However, Brendan/May successfully calmed the weather Pokémon when they defeated it{{sup/3|RS}}{{sup/6|ORAS}} or summoned {{p|Rayquaza}} to calm them{{sup/3|E}}. Brendan/May then proceeded to beat the Pokémon League and become the Champion, and was invited to compete in the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}{{sup/3|E}}.

Upon becoming the Champion, a meteor changed course towards Hoenn{{sup/6|ORAS}}. May's/Brendan's, [[Wally]]'s, and [[Archie]]'s{{sup/6|AS}}/[[Maxie]]'s{{sup/6|OR}} [[Key Stone]]s were stolen by [[Zinnia]] in an attempt to summon {{p|Rayquaza}} to avert the crisis. Brendan/May encountered Zinnia at [[Sky Pillar]] and successfully summoned Rayquaza. Brendan/May gave Rayquaza the power to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] and it destroyed the meteor.

==Geography==
===Environment===
[[File:Hoenn Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Hoenn in Pokémon Adventures]]
[[File:Hoenn Evolutions.png|thumb|250px|Hoenn in [[Pokémon Evolutions]]]]
The Hoenn region is a group of islands that boasts many dramatic environments from [[Hoenn Route 119|rainforests]] to [[Hoenn Route 111|deserts]], but its most striking feature is its abundance of water, a strong contrast to other core series regions, especially Sinnoh. Much of the region is covered in water, almost equal in size to the mainland, exemplifying the theme of the games. There are several large and populated islands off the mainland only accessible via [[water route]]s, many of which are deep enough for {{m|Dive|diving}}.

Much of the interior area is forested or mountainous, so most notable cities are found on the coastline. People who live in towns and villages in the mountain areas must adapt to the harsh environment. An extreme example of this is the inhabitants of [[Fortree City]], who live in tree houses. This is in stark contrast to other regions in the [[Pokémon world]], as noted by {{adv|Ruby}} in [[Pokémon Adventures]], who preferred Johto's many modernized cities to the wilderness and countryside in Hoenn. Hoenn has one active volcano, [[Mt. Chimney]], in the northwest of the region. The ash from Mt. Chimney regularly falls on the nearby towns and routes. On the opposite side of the Hoenn region lies the volcanic{{sup/3|RSE}}/impact{{sup/6|ORAS}} crater which [[Sootopolis City]] was built in.

Some of Hoenn's newly discovered Pokémon strongly reflect the influence of the primarily tropical environment.

===Climate===
Hoenn seems to have a warmer climate than other regions, similar to an equatorial climate. This may mean that Hoenn is located closer to the equator than the other regions.

The mainland experiences a wide variety of weather across its breadth. Ashes constantly fall around [[Mt. Chimney]] in the northwest. Constant, extreme {{weather|sandstorm}}s afflict the arid desert near its center. Frequent {{weather|rain}} falls on the mainland's northeastern areas, nourishing the rainforests and {{DL|tall grass|long grass}} that grow there.

===Demographics===
The towns, cities, and areas of the Hoenn region's total population in {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}} is 598. In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], the total population of  Hoenn's towns, cities, and areas is 694. Upon its introduction in [[Generation III]], it was the largest region by population. As of [[Generation VIII]], it is the sixth largest region by population.

===Notable locations===
Hoenn has sixteen [[List of cities and towns|cities and towns]], including a {{ho|Pokémon League}}. Since the majority of the cities and towns of Hoenn are immersed into nature, there aren't many large cities comparable to [[Unova]]'s [[Castelia City]] or [[Kalos]]'s [[Lumiose City]], with the largest city being [[Lilycove City]]{{sup/3|RSE}}/[[Mauville City]]{{sup/6|ORAS}}.

The Hoenn region has 34 different [[route]]s, which are passages permitting Trainers to travel from one location to the next with relative ease. Much like [[Sinnoh]] after it, Hoenn's routes are numbered so that they don't follow sequence directly from previously-known regions' routes. Routes in Hoenn are numbered from {{rtn|101|Hoenn}} to {{rtn|134|Hoenn}}. Compared to other regions, Hoenn features an abundance of sea routes. This gives the impression that the Hoenn region is half-water and half-land, which references the battle of Groudon and Kyogre.

The Hoenn region is unique and famous for its tropical-like environments. The region does not feature a true mountain range like in Sinnoh and other regions. Hoenn introduced many new natural environments including a volcano, a jungle, a beach, a desert, and many more. The Hoenn region also introduced the idea of routes with differing [[weather]], including constant rainfall, thunderstorms, falling ash, and rays of sunlight.

====Routes====
Routes in Hoenn are numbered as {{rtn|101|Hoenn}}-{{rtn|134|Hoenn}}, breaking the former pattern set up by Kanto and Johto. This is presumably to discourage the idea of being able to travel back to either region after completion of the game, as was done in [[Generation II]] and as a mirror of the fact that Japan's road system possesses a similar gap. Some of the routes have differing [[weather]] depending on the day they are traveled on.

==Trivia==
* Hoenn has the most [[route]]s of any [[region]], with a total of 34.
* Hoenn is the only region with:
** A Game Corner and department store that are not in the same city. The [[Mauville Game Corner]] is located in [[Mauville City]], whereas the [[Lilycove Department Store]] is located in [[Lilycove City]].
** [[Gym]]s in which all [[Badge]]s have the same English and Japanese names.
** [[Norman|A father]] for the [[player character]] that can be encountered.
** Neither {{p|Eevee}} nor any of its evolved forms in its [[Regional Pokédex]].
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Hoenn is "Hoennian", as revealed in the Official [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] Guide.

The '''Johto''' region (Japanese: '''ジョウト{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''{{tt|Johto|Jouto}} {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. Johto is located west of [[Kanto]], which together form a joint landmass that is south of [[Sinnoh]] and [[Sinjoh Ruins]].

It was the second [[core series]] region to be introduced. First explored in {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, it is home to an additional 100 {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that were not present in [[Generation I|the previous games]]. It is also the setting of {{game|Crystal}}, {{game|HeartGold}}, and {{game|SoulSilver}}.

Players begin their journey in [[New Bark Town]], where [[Professor Elm]] offers either {{p|Chikorita}}, {{p|Cyndaquil}}, or {{p|Totodile}} to beginning [[Pokémon Trainer]]s. 

The English-version names of most of the cities in Johto are names of plants or things related to plants.

==Etymology and design concept==
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Johto|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Johto}}
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world.png|thumb|left|200px|The map of Japan showing the Johto region as the {{wp|Kansai region}}.]]
[[Junichi Masuda]] has stated in his director's column that the kanji that inspired the name mean "castle capital" (城都)<ref name="Masuda No. 149">[https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir/2009/05/index.html Hidden Power of Masuda: No. 149]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDJuM8C5g-8 New Pokemon Gold & Silver Facts Discovered]</ref> or "lattice-plan capital" (条都)<ref name="Masuda No. 149"/>; this meaning is connected to the city of {{wp|Nara, Nara|Nara}}, which was the basis for [[Violet City]].

Johto is based on the real {{wp|Kansai region}} in Japan.<ref>(July 2000). [http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/gfreak/page04.html 『ポケットモンスター』開発スタッフインタビュー (ページｄ)]。 ''Nintendo Online Magazine'' (N.O.M). No.23.</ref> Kansai and {{wp|Kantō region|Kantō}} are the two most populous areas of {{wp|Honshū}}, the largest island of Japan, and much like Johto and [[Kanto]], represent a harmony of contrasting cultures living together. Compared to modern Kantō, Kansai is linked to the past, and known for its historical temples, shrines, palaces, gardens, and architecture. {{wp|Kyoto}}, which is the basis for [[Ecruteak City]], is considered the cultural center of Japan; although {{wp|Osaka}}, which is the basis for [[Goldenrod City]], is typically modern.

==History==
===Dated history===
* 1,500 years prior: The place now known as the Ruins of Alph was built in Johto. Although no one knows exactly who built the Ruins of Alph, research indicates that the people in question were an ancient civilization that wished to co-exist with the enigmatic {{p|Unown}} that bear great similarity to the alphabet letters. 
* At some point later, outsiders began to gather near the ruins. As the Unown were timid creatures, they rejected contact with anyone but the clan that protected them. To ensure the Unown's well being, the Ruins of Alph's inhabitants decided to leave the region, but not without devising complicated puzzles so that one day the Unown could be summoned again. As for the clan, their quest led them to a mountain far to the north, where they met another group of people who had hailed from the [[Spear Pillar]]. Together, the two groups built a temple in honor of {{p|Arceus}}, which incorporated elements from both the Ruins of Alph and the Spear Pillar; this collaboration probably has to do with the underlying relationship between Arceus and the Unown. The temple, too, has since been left in ruins and its lowest floor is now known as the [[Sinjoh Ruins]]; however, the ritual of honoring [[Legendary Pokémon]] through dance circulated back to Johto, specifically to [[Ecruteak City]].
* About 700 years prior: The people of Ecruteak built two nine-tier towers with the hopes of fostering friendship and hope between Pokémon and [[human]]s. They were the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] in the west, which was said to awaken Pokémon, and the [[Bell Tower]] in the east, where Pokémon were said to rest. Both towers became the roost of powerful flying Pokémon: {{p|Lugia}} and {{p|Ho-Oh}}, respectively.
* 500 years prior: The Cianwood City Pharmacy, the world's oldest pharmacy, was built. 
* 400 years prior: [[Azalea Town]] in Johto was struck by a long-term drought wave; after bringing the rain back once again by {{m|yawn}}ing, {{p|Slowpoke}} gained an honorable position in that town.
[[File:Brass Tower HGSS.png|thumb|150px|The burned [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]]]
* 150 years prior: A lightning bolt struck the Brass Tower, engulfing in flames that raged for three days. A sudden downpour finally put out the blaze, but it had already burnt to the ground. [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon#Original Legendary beasts|Three nameless Pokémon]] perished in the fire, but Ho-Oh descended from the sky and resurrected them. The revived Pokémon were made to embody three powers: the {{p|Raikou|lightning}} that struck the tower, the {{p|Entei|fire}} that burned the tower, and the {{p|Suicune|rain}} that put out the fire. When the Pokémon appeared, they struck terror in those who saw their rise. The three Pokémon, knowing their own power, fled, [[roaming Pokémon|running like the wind]] off into Johto's grassland. Similarly, both Lugia and Ho-Oh flew away at the sight of the growing distance between people and Pokémon; while they never returned to Ecruteak, they yearned for a person to touch the hearts and souls of Pokémon once more.

===Contemporary history===
{{Spoilers}}
{{ga|Ethan}}/{{ga|Kris}}/{{ga|Lyra}} leave [[New Bark Town]] on an errand for [[Professor Elm]]. A {{ga|Silver|red-haired boy}} steals one of Elm's three Pokémon, and challenges him/her as Ethan/Kris/Lyra's journey across Johto continues.[[Team Rocket]], which were revived from Kanto, uses plans formulated three years prior to enrage many {{p|Gyarados}}, including a [[Red Gyarados|shiny one]] at the [[Lake of Rage]]; they then proceed to take over the [[Goldenrod Radio Tower]] in a desperate attempt to contact [[Giovanni]]. When they are defeated and Giovanni fails to return due to {{p|Celebi}}'s intervention, the interim leader, [[Archer]], vows to never again re-form Team Rocket. Ethan/Kris/Lyra continues to gather Johto's Badges, eventually gaining all eight and traveling to the [[Pokémon League]] at [[Indigo Plateau]] in Kanto, later to defeat the [[Lance|current Champion]] and get into the [[Hall of Fame]].

But Ethan/Kris/Lyra's most notable effect on Johto lies in their ability to encounter all three of the [[Legendary beasts]], as well as summon the Unown, Lugia and Ho-Oh after their long absence. A new chapter in the region's history begins.

==Geography==
The Johto region, like its neighboring region, [[Kanto]], has a temperate climate. However, Johto's climate is a bit wetter than that of Kanto's.

Johto is notably more rural than the Kanto region, which leans more towards to the urban side. The region has an abundance of water to the west and south, with [[Cianwood City]] most likely being on a separate landmass. However, Johto is still dominated by land. The western parts of the region are mainly low-lying and forested and contain most of the region's population. Johto's ultra-modern [[Goldenrod City]] is found in the heart of the region, on the coast. It is the technological, industrial, and economic area of the Johto region. Due to its centralized position in the region, many smaller but important cities and towns connect to the city. There is one large mountain range encompassing almost the entire eastern half of the region, which separates Kanto and Johto and contains [[Mt. Silver]]. [[Blackthorn City]] is nestled deep between the mountains and is very unique because it is a city for {{tc|Dragon Tamer}}s.

===Demographics===
{{outdated|section}}
In the Johto region, including all the towns, cities, and other areas, the total population in {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}} is 452. As of [[Generation VIII]], it is the seventh largest region by population.

===Notable locations===
Johto has ten [[List of cities and towns|cities and towns]]. These sites act as settlements for people to live and work in a functioning society. The [[Safari Zone Gate]] and [[Frontier Access]] act as towns, but they appear to be more of a tourist destination and are not considered cities or towns. As Johto has no autonomous [[Pokémon League]], Kanto shares a League with the region, which borders between Johto and Kanto. Because of this, the two regions share a connection with each other, and unlike any other region, they are able to be traversed to with relative ease. Due to this landmass connection, the geography of Johto is relatively similar to that of its neighbor region.

The Johto region has 20 different [[routes]], which are passages permitting Trainers to travel from one location to the next with relative ease. Johto and Kanto share the same route system, and therefore starts at {{rt|29|Johto}}, picking up from where Kanto's left off at {{rt|28|Kanto}}. The numbered routes count up to 48, with Routes {{rtn|47|Johto}} and {{rtn|48|Johto}} leading off into the far west only being accessible in [[Generation IV]]. Compared to the Kanto region, there aren't many sea routes; there are many land routes and mountains. Some areas such as {{rt|33|Johto}} are constantly raining, or are purged with other types of [[weather]]; however, this wasn't seen until [[Generation IV]].

The connecting landmass between Kanto and Johto doesn't appear to be a fine line; but more or less a blurry one. {{rt|28|Kanto}} is technically owned by Kanto; however, it bridges the border between the two regions, making it the only route in history that enters two regions at one time. This is similar to Routes {{rtn|26|Kanto}} and {{rtn|27|Kanto}}, that are strictly Kanto locations; however, they are able to be transported to via {{HM|02|Fly}} from Johto in Generation IV.

====Landmarks====
[[File:Ecruteak City Landscape.png|300px|thumb|View of [[Ecruteak City]], with [[Violet City]]'s [[Sprout Tower]], [[Mahogany Town]], the [[Lake of Rage]], and [[Blackthorn City]] in the distance; [[Mt. Silver]] towers over the region in the greater distance.]]
Johto features some unique and scenic landmarks, whether they be natural or man-made. It prides itself towards mythology and tradition features, with most of the buildings, towers, caves, and locations holding a historical background. Some of the oldest places in Johto, even the Pokémon world, include the [[Ruins of Alph]], [[Sprout Tower]], [[Bell Tower]], [[Burned Tower]], and the [[Slowpoke Well]].

The Ruins of Alph, located in central Johto, is the threshold to an ancient civilization that first contacted the Unown, and became the base of which the first system for writing was formed. The Ruins of Alph have said to have been around for at least 1500 years before modern times which makes it one of the first known structures built in the history of Pokémon. As of today, the ruins are being researched by scientists and are able to be visited as a tourist attraction by visitors.

The two towers of Ecruteak City which include the [[Bell Tower]] and the [[Burned Tower]] are oldest towers in the Pokémon world, dating back to 700 years ago. The two nine-tier towers were built to foster friendship and hope between Pokémon and people and the view from the top of the towers was said to be magnificent. The towers attracted many people to the city, until about 150 years ago, a lightning bolt struck the western tower, engulfing it in flames, burning the tower down. The towers are surrounded in mystery, and are said to be home to [[Legendary Pokémon]], however, at this present point, only the ruins of the Burned Tower can be explored by Trainers, and the Bell Tower is off limits to most people.

Another famous historic location is the Sprout Tower, located in northern Violet City. The Sprout Tower is a tiered tower with multiple eaves, and much like the [[Bell Tower]] and the [[Burned Tower]], it is constructed solely out of wood, creating a multi-story effect. Surrounding the tower is a beautiful lake in the center of Violet City, hosting several architectural bridges making its way across the water. Sprout Tower is dedicated to the gentle and peaceful nature of {{p|Bellsprout}}. The giant spine-like pillar located in the center of the tower acts as a support for the old tower structure, and it even protects the tall tower from sudden earthquakes. It is said that the main swaying pillar was, in fact, once a 100-foot-tall Bellsprout. Spout Tower is four stories tall. The ground floor is much like a visitors floor, where tourists come to see the unique style of which the tower was formed. There are three other upper levels, which are dedicated to Pokémon Training; monks who study diligently and train their gentle {{p|Bellsprout}} come to teach that all living beings coexist through cooperation.

Johto also features several different kinds of natural caves and mountains including [[Mt. Mortar]], [[Mt. Silver]], [[Dark Cave]], [[Ice Path]], [[Cliff Cave]], and [[Union Cave]]. Mt. Mortar is a cave complex that travels through Johto's northernmost mountain range. It is known by Trainers to be a confusing maze-like area with an interior cave known as the Waterfall Cave. Mt. Mortar has three entrances and is huge inside, one of the largest of all caves in the Johto. It has four floors, and its high Pokémon-encounter rate makes getting lost very costly. It has {{m|Surf}}able waterways, {{m|Waterfall}}s, {{m|Strength}} puzzles, and multiple levels. Dark Cave travels through central Johto, and although the dark caves run beneath the surface of the region, the mountain range is large and a barrier between areas of the region. Mt. Silver, in the east, is also quite large and complex splitting the two regions of Kanto and Johto in half, housing many powerful Pokémon, and it is where the most skilled Trainers train their Pokémon. Another natural landmark in Johto is [[Ilex Forest]] located just west of Azalea Town. The forest's trees are so close together that all light is blocked out, and the forest seems to be in a perpetual night.

Some famous man-made landmarks include the [[Goldenrod Radio Tower]], {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|IV}}, [[Pokéathlon Dome]], and {{safari|Johto}}. The Goldenrod Radio Tower is a five-story tower located next to the Magnet Train station in downtown Goldenrod City. The radio tower broadcasts numerous programs daily, the most prominent of such being Professor Oak's Pokémon Talk and Buena's Password. For a short period time the tower fell victim to the clutches of Team Rocket, during which time none of the normal broadcasts were aired. The {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|IV}}, [[Pokéathlon Dome]], and {{safari|Johto}} are all recently built attractions which provide entertainment and fun for tourists, allowing visitors to participate in activities and rides which require the help of Pokémon to complete.

Although the Johto region prides itself on the beach and some of its sea-side towns, the region has very few aquatic landmarks. The [[Lake of Rage]] is the region's most prominent water attraction, said to have been a smoking crater until it filled with rainwater. The lake is home to the world-famous [[red Gyarados]]. Because of this irritable Pokémon, the lake was marked a dangerous place to go, since the Gyarados started tipping over boats and scaring swimmers. Another famous water landmark is the [[Whirl Islands]]. Named after the dangerous whirlpools that surround them, the Whirl Islands are four islands between Olivine and Cianwood City that are connected by a maze-like cavernous structure under the water's surface. It is said that at the heart of the caves a Legendary Pokémon can be found.

==Johto League==
{{main|Johto League}}
The Johto League is the regional [[Pokémon League]] of the Johto region. Johto and Kanto share a single [[Elite Four]], located at Indigo Plateau. Eight Johto League [[Badge]]s are required to participate in [[Pokémon League#Types of competitions|League competitions]]. The [[Indigo League]] and Johto League share a single group of Elite Four and {{pkmn|Champion}}; eight Badges from either region will allow a Trainer to battle the Elite Four at [[Indigo Plateau]]. Less commonly, it is known as the "Silver League", usually when referring to the {{pkmn|animation}}. The [[Silver Conference]] is the Johto League's annual [[Pokémon League#Championship competitions|championship competition]]. It is held at the base of Mt. Silver.

==Trivia==
* Johto lacks some elements that other [[region]]s have. These omissions are due to it sharing them with [[Kanto]], which could be visited later on in the same {{pkmn|games}}, and the fact that recycling old concepts have not become the norm yet in the games. Therefore, it is the only region without:
** its own [[Pokémon League]] (although {{aniseries|PTS}} gives it the [[Silver Conference]]).
** a notable {{type|Water}} and {{type|Fire}} [[Type expert|specialist]].
* Johto shares its Pokémon League, [[Bill|Storage System developer]], and [[Team Rocket|villainous team]] with Kanto.
* In [[Generation II|Generations II]] and IV, between Johto and [[Kanto]], the {{t|Dark}} type and the {{t|Ground}} type are the only types not represented by an official Gym. [[Viridian City]], whose previous Gym Leader was [[Giovanni]], had the Ground type. However, when Giovanni left the Gym after being defeated by {{ga|Red}}, he was replaced by {{ga|Blue}}, who does not have a type specialty. [[Karen]] of the [[Elite Four]] uses Dark-type Pokémon, making the Ground type the only type to not have a [[Gym Leader]] or Elite Four member specialized in it in Johto and Kanto for Generations II and IV.
* Unused location data for Johto (similar to the data for [[Hoenn]] and [[Kanto]] used for Pal Park) exists within the programming of Generation IV's games. Pokémon actually caught in Johto, however, display as being from "[[faraway place]]" when traded to a game taking place in [[Sinnoh]], much like Pokémon caught in a Platinum-exclusive location do when traded to Diamond or Pearl.
* Kanto and Johto are the only regions that are connected to each other by land.
* In the {{pkmn|games}}, Johto is the only region so far which didn't appear in a game where the {{t|Fairy|Fairy type}} exists.
* In the {{pkmn|animation}}, Johto is the only region so far in which:
** {{Ash}} did not meet a new {{ashfr|traveling companion}}.
** There is not at least one official Gym Badge that isn't from the games.
** Ash used {{AP|Pikachu}} in every Gym battle.
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Johto is "Johtonian", as revealed in the Official [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] Guide.

The '''Kalos''' region (Japanese: '''カロス{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Kalos {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. It was the sixth [[core series]] region to be introduced and is the setting of {{g|X and Y}} and {{g|Legends: Z-A}}.

It is shaped like a five-pointed star, with one of its biggest cities being [[Lumiose City]] in the north-central part of the region. It features a vast network of rivers and waterways snaking through much of its landscape, cities and towns. North-east of Lumiose City lies a mountain range where more frigid temperatures exist, extending down into the plains below. Western Kalos features a vast ocean, where the shoreside city of [[Shalour City]] lies in the middle of a cove.

==Etymology and design concept==
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world-Europe.png|thumb|left|250px|The map of Europe showing the Kalos region as northern {{wp|France}}.]]
===Etymology===
According to [[Junichi Masuda]], Kalos's name is derived from the Greek word κάλλος ''kállos'', meaning beauty.<ref name=Honedge>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pG-q-WIYTs Pokémon X and Pokémon Y: Honedge Revealed!] (YouTube)</ref>

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Kalos|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Kalos}}
Kalos is based on {{wp|France}};<ref name=Honedge/><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrL3I38VO3o Pokémon X and Pokémon Y Developer Roundtable Recap] (YouTube)</ref> specifically, it most closely resembles the northern half of {{wp|Metropolitan France}}. According to Junichi Masuda, France was chosen as a basis for Kalos because the development team considered it a good fit for Pokémon X and Y's theme of "beauty".<ref>Nutt, Christian (September 19, 2013).

==History==
===Dated history===
* 3,000 years prior to the events of {{G|X and Y}}, war broke out between Kalos and another [[region]], which eventually caused the death of the [[AZ#Befriended|Floette]] that belonged to the king of Kalos, [[AZ]]. Determined to bring the Pokémon back to life, AZ built a machine, that using [[Infinity Energy]], ressurected the Floette. Unable to forgive those who took it from him, AZ turned the machine into the [[ultimate weapon]] and blasted the battlefield, killing many and ending the war. As a side effect of the blast, both AZ and Floette were given eternal life. Horrified for what AZ has done, the Floette left him. AZ soon left Kalos and started wandering aimlessly around the {{pkmn|world}}. After the incident, AZ's younger brother hid the weapon underneath [[Geosenge Town]].
* 800 years prior to the events of Pokémon X and Y, {{p|Xerneas}} released{{sup/6|X}}/{{p|Yveltal}} absorbed{{sup/6|Y}} life energy throughout the Kalos region upon reaching the end of its life cycle. Afterward, it withdrew into hibernation deep within a forest{{sup/6|X}}/mountain range{{sup/6|Y}}.
* 300 years prior to the events of Pokémon X and Y, [[Parfum Palace]] was built by a king who wished to display his power to all.

===Contemporary history===
{{spoilers}}
In contemporary history, {{ga|Calem}}/{{ga|Serena}} leaves their home in [[Vaniville Town]], meeting [[Shauna]] and Serena/Calem, who invite them to join the pair for a meeting in [[Aquacorde Town]]. Calem, Serena, and Shauna receive their [[first partner Pokémon]] from [[Tierno]] and a [[Pokédex]] from [[Trevor]] on behalf of [[Professor Sycamore]]. After delivering a letter to their {{kal|Grace|Mom}} from Professor Sycamore, they head on an adventure traveling across Kalos challenging [[Gym]]s in order to earn eight [[Badge]]s to then challenge the {{kal|Pokémon League}}. Over the course of their {{pkmn|journey}}, they come into contact with [[Team Flare]], an organization whose goal is to create a "beautiful and better" world while making money. They try to do this by stealing [[Fossil]]s from [[Glittering Cave]], siphoning electricity from the [[Kalos Power Plant]], stealing the [[Poké Ball]]s from the [[Poké Ball Factory]] in [[Laverre City]], and attempting to agitate and capture an {{p|Abomasnow}}. Calem/Serena also encounters a mysterious giant called [[AZ]] on several occasions, initially on [[Kalos Route 13]]. After earning their seventh Badge from [[Olympia]], Calem/Serena is contacted by [[Lysandre]], a man introduced by Professor Sycamore, who reveals both himself as the leader of Team Flare, and his intention to use the "[[ultimate weapon]]" to eliminate all life in the world except for those in Team Flare. Calem/Serena battle Lysandre, first in [[Lysandre Labs]], and again in the [[Team Flare Secret HQ]], before making their way down to the basement where they find {{p|Xerneas}}{{sup/6|X}}/{{p|Yveltal}}{{sup/6|Y}} and battle them, before battling against Lysandre once more. Even though Lysandre is defeated, and Calem/Serena and their friends reason with him, he still fires the ultimate weapon. The blast the weapon emits destroys it and buries Lysandre and the HQ, ultimately disbanding Team Flare. Calem/Serena then heads to the Pokémon League where they defeat the [[Elite Four]] and [[Diantha]], becoming {{pkmn|Champion}} of Kalos. Professor Sycamore then holds a grand ceremony in Kalos to celebrate Calem/Serena's victory, and all of their friends' efforts in defeating [[Team Flare]]. During the ceremony, a large mysterious man challenges Calem/Serena to a battle and is defeated, but is grateful to them, for in the battle, he finally felt free from the sorrow and rage he felt in creating the ultimate weapon. As such, the man is revealed to be the ancient king [[AZ]], and having once again become the man who loved Pokémon with all his heart, his long lost partner {{p|Floette}} returns to him, resulting in a tearful reunion.

After the ceremony, Calem/Serena is invited to [[Kiloude City]] to partake in its [[Battle Maison]], and is given a train pass for it by Professor Sycamore. After partaking in a few battles there, they are informed by Professor Sycamore that the Anistar sundial can radiate special energy, and their [[Mega Ring]] is upgraded to be able to locate Mega Stones hidden across Kalos during twilight. Calem/Serena then returns to [[Lumiose City]], where they are contacted by [[Looker]], who has a series of cases he wants them to investigate. Calem/Serena takes part in a series of trials across Lumiose and become's Looker's second-in-command. During the investigations, Calem/Serena and Looker meet an orphan girl named [[Emma]] and her {{p|Espurr}} named Mimi, who are living in the alleys of Lumiose. Eventually, Looker offers to let Emma live in the {{DL|North Boulevard|Looker Bureau}}. However, soon after, a mysterious figure vandalizes the [[Lumiose Museum]] and also lures Trainers in to steal their Pokémon. Upon investigating these cases, and through the help of [[Malva]], they learn that the crimes are being committed by [[Essentia]], who is actually Emma in a suit that enhances her power, but she is unconscious in doing this: she is actually being controlled by [[Xerosic]]. Calem/Serena and Looker track Xerosic down to a secret floor in Lysandre Labs, and manage to defeat Essentia in a series of battles. Looker captures Xerosic, and takes him away, and parts ways with Calem/Serena and Emma, and despite the latter's hesitance, Looker reassures her that their bonds will always be strong no matter how far apart they are.

==Geography==
[[File:Gloire City Castle.png|thumb|250px|left|One of the region's many castles in {{aniseries|XY}}]]
[[File:Kalos Pokédex map.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of the Kalos region, with its three primary divisions highlighted]]
The geography of Kalos varies greatly within the region. The region is naturally bordered by a vast ocean to the west and northwest, and the eastern and southern borders are formed by mountain ranges. These borders give the region its signature star-like shape, as a large peninsula reaches out to the sea in the northwest, creating one point, and elsewhere the coastline, mountain ranges and rivers create the remaining four points. Kalos is made up of three distinct divisions, all with their own unique characteristics in both geography and Pokémon: Central Kalos, Coastal Kalos, and Mountain Kalos. The bustling [[Lumiose City]] is located near the point where all three divisions meet.

Central Kalos is located in the centric and southern parts of the region. The area is dominated by large forested plains with multiple rivers crossing it, with very few changes in elevation. Several towns are surrounded by walls of some sort, and there are also many old castles and {{wp|château}}s. Many important human settlements and landmarks are located here, such as [[Vaniville Town]], [[Santalune City]], a portion of Lumiose City, and the [[Parfum Palace]].

Coastal Kalos is located by the vast sea in the western parts of Kalos. The mainly explored area is a strip between mountains and the sea. This area is dominated by rocky shores in the southwest and lush beaches and forests in the northwest. Most human settlements are located by the sea.  The peninsula in the northwest is known for its {{wp|menhir}} stones. There are many important locations, such as the [[Reflection Cave]], [[Geosenge Town]], and [[Shalour City]] with its [[Tower of Mastery]].

Mountain Kalos is located in the eastern reaches of the region. The area is largely mountainous and the temperatures tend to be cooler than in the other parts, with some routes and settlements having snow covering them. To the north there is a marshy area that is said to be haunted. However, the settlements are plentiful, and there are some important landmarks, such as the [[Kalos Power Plant]] that is built on a harsh wasteland, the [[Poké Ball Factory]] in [[Laverre City]], and the {{kal|Pokémon League}}.

[[Kiloude City]] is located outside the three divisions, and is only reachable by train from Lumiose City. The city is relatively isolated from the other parts of the region, being completely surrounded by mountains.
{{-}}

===Demographics===
The Kalos region has a total population of 1288 including all the towns, cities, routes, and areas. Since its introduction in [[Generation VI]], it has been the largest region by population.

===Notable locations===
Kalos has sixteen cities and towns, and a Pokémon League.

Like in Unova, the routes of Kalos start counting again from 1, likely to represent its geographical isolation from the previously introduced regions. There are 22 routes in total. 

In {{aniseries|PTS}}, like Unova, Kalos was far enough away from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh to require traveling via airplane (as evidenced by how {{Ash}} and [[Alexa]] arrived in the region, as well as how Ash and Serena left the region for Kanto and Hoenn, respectively).

==Trivia==
* The English and Japanese names of cities and towns in Kalos are derived from various ingredients used in fragrances. Likewise, the names in the European versions are derived from various terminologies related to art.
* Kalos is the only [[region]] in which:
** All Gym Leaders and Elite Four members use teams consisting entirely of Pokémon of the type they use.
** All Routes have alternate names.
** There is more than one status-healing local specialty food item: the [[Lumiose Galette]] and the [[Shalour Sable]], although the latter cannot be obtained in {{g|X and Y}} without trading.
* The Kalos region has the largest regional [[Pokédex]] of all regions.
* Kalos has the largest population of any region, with 1,288 inhabitants living in its cities, towns, and other areas.
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Kalos is "Kalosian", as seen in [[Kiloude City]]'s map description.

The '''Kanto''' region (Japanese: '''カントー{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''{{tt|Kanto|Kantō}} {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. Kanto is located east of [[Johto]], which together form a joint landmass that is south of [[Sinnoh]].

Kanto is the setting of the [[Generation I|first generation]] of {{{p|games}}} and can be explored in [[Generation]]s {{gen|II}}, {{gen|III}}, {{gen|IV}}, and {{gen|VII}}.

[[Professor Oak]] is the resident [[Pokémon Professor]] and gives [[Pokémon Trainer]]s a choice between {{p|Bulbasaur}}, {{p|Charmander}}, or {{p|Squirtle}} as their [[first partner Pokémon]]. In {{game|Yellow}}, Oak intended to give the player an {{p|Eevee}}, but after his grandson {{ga|Blue}} takes it instead, he gives the player a {{OBP|Pikachu|Yellow}} that he had just caught. In {{LGPE|Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!}}, the player chooses Pikachu, while in Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!, the player chooses Eevee. In the games, the player begins their journey in [[Pallet Town]] and ends it at the [[Indigo Plateau]].

The artwork from the early games depict Kanto as grassland. Starting in Generation III, it is shown with denser tree coverage.

All cities in Kanto are named after colors, with the exception of Pallet Town, which refers to a ''palette'', meaning a range of colors. Unlike every other region, Kanto's fictional name reflects its [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world|real-world]] name.

==Etymology and design concept==
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Kanto|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Kanto}}
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world.png|thumb|left|200px|The map of Japan showing the Kanto region as the {{wp|Kantō region}}.]]
Kanto is based on the real {{wp|Kantō region}} ({{tt|関|かん}}{{tt|東|とう}}, ''east of the barrier'') in Japan. Commercially-oriented [[Celadon City]] and [[Saffron City]] are based on the sprawling city of {{wp|Tokyo}}, the most important economic center of Japan. [[Vermilion City]] is based on {{wp|Yokohama}}, the largest seaport in {{wp|Japan}}.

Kantō and {{wp|Kansai region|Kansai}} are the two most populous areas of {{wp|Honshū}}, the largest island of Japan, and much like Kanto and Johto, represent a harmony of contrasting cultures living together. The differences are most noticeable in the games while talking to the inhabitants of both regions. Compared to traditional Kansai, on which Johto is based, Kanto is modern and technological. This may be reflected in the look of the cities and the buildings, such as the [[Cinnabar Lab|Pokémon Lab]] of [[Cinnabar Island]] and the [[Kanto Power Plant|Power Plant]]. While Kanto is the centerpoint for innovation, with the [[Poké Ball]]'s ultimate upgrade, the [[Master Ball]], having been recently invented by [[Silph Co.]] at the time of [[Generation I]], it is also the only Pokémon region without any myths related to Pokémon.

==History==
[[File:Capsule Monsters map.jpg|thumb|200px|An early design of Kanto from [[Capsule Monsters]]]]
The Kanto region has a rich history of creating Pokémon with technology.

Many researchers have had great success in creating life in Kanto. [[Mr. Fuji|A researcher]] once cloned {{p|Mew}} through its genes and created the Genetic Pokémon {{p|Mewtwo}}. {{p|Porygon}}, the Virtual Pokémon, was also created by researchers in Kanto.

{{Spoilers}}

In contemporary history, {{ga|Red}}/{{ga|Leaf}} is given a Pokémon by [[Professor Oak]] for personal safety. Professor Oak also gives his grandson, {{ga|Blue}}, a Pokémon and asks Blue and Red/Leaf to help him fill the Pokédex, a complete encyclopedia on Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Red/Leaf begins. Red/Leaf travels across the Kanto region and collects all eight Gym Badges. During their journey, Red/Leaf comes across [[Team Rocket]], an evil organization behind the theft and illegal profit of Pokémon. Red/Leaf stops Team Rocket and defeats [[Giovanni]], their boss, as well as the Gym Leader of [[Viridian Gym]], who then disbands Team Rocket. In the meantime, Blue, who has also collected all of the Kanto Gym Badges, defeats the [[Elite Four]] at the [[Indigo League]] and becomes the champion of the Kanto region. Finally, Red/Leaf also reaches the Indigo League and defeats Blue to gain the title of the new Indigo League Champion.

Three years later, {{ga|Ethan}}/{{ga|Kris}}/{{ga|Lyra}}, a Trainer that hails from Johto, comes to Kanto and collects all eight Kanto Gym Badges. Ethan/Kris/Lyra is then the current Indigo League Champion that met and defeated Red.

==Geography==
[[File:Kanto anime.png|thumb|250px|Kanto in {{aniseries|DP}}]]
[[File:Kanto Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Kanto in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
The Kanto region has a very temperate climate and not many notable landscape features, though this may be due to the region's origins in the [[Generation I]] games.

The majority of the Kanto region are forests and plains. Many of the major Kanto cities are in the center of the region, with close access to virtually every environment such as the sea, mountains, forests, etc. Kanto is mostly dominated by land, but has a large bay in the middle which opens to a sea in the southwest. Kanto has a contrast between urban cities and rural towns. Kanto has several mountain ranges, which are mostly in northern and western Kanto. [[Indigo Plateau]] and {{ka|Victory Road}} mountain range divides Kanto from the neighboring [[Johto]] region.

===Demographics===
Including all the cities and towns in the Kanto region, the total population in [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Red, Blue]], [[Pokémon Yellow Version|Yellow]], {{2v2|FireRed|LeafGreen}} is 391, while in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions|Gold, Silver]], [[Pokémon Crystal Version|Crystal]], {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, the population is 364. Since [[Generation II]], it has been the smallest region by population.

===Notable locations===
The Kanto region features ten [[List of cities and towns|towns and cities]]. There is a wide variety of towns and cities throughout the region; from the large, urban [[Saffron City]] to the quiet, quaint town of {{to|Pallet}}. Kanto features a [[Pokémon League]], like most other regions in the [[Pokémon world]]. However, since Kanto shares its borders with [[Johto]], it also shares the same Pokémon League. Kanto and Johto are the only known regions that can be crossed with relative ease. Even though Kanto and Johto are culturally and socially different, the two regions are actually very similar in terms of geography.

The Kanto region includes 28 different routes, which act as roads to cities and towns or points of interest. The Johto region follows Kanto's route number which ends at {{rt|28|Kanto}} in the Kanto region and begins with Johto's {{rt|29|Johto}}. Unlike other regions, Kanto does not have routes featuring any sort of weather conditions, such as [[Hoenn]]'s {{rt|119|Hoenn}} which rains and thunders constantly and [[Sinnoh]]'s {{rt|217|Sinnoh}} in which hail regularly falls. The Kanto region seems to have the most temperate climate of the nine main [[region]]s.

The connecting landmass between Kanto and Johto does not appear to be a fine line, but more or less a blurry one. Route 28 is technically owned by Kanto; however, it bridges the border between the two regions, making it the only route in history that enters two regions at one time. This is similar to Routes 26 and 27, that are strictly Kanto locations; however, they are able to be transported to via {{HM|02|Fly}} from Johto in Generation IV.

According to [[Professor Oak]], a stone tablet was discovered in Kanto, like the one that is able to summon {{p|Shaymin}} on {{rt|224|Sinnoh}} in Sinnoh. This is mentioned during the event in which the {{player}} {{pkmn2|caught|catches}} a Shaymin in {{game2|Diamond|Pearl|Platinum}}, but the Kanto stone tablet is not seen in any game.

===Differences between generations===
Between Generation I and Generation III, Kanto is very much the same with some alterations in respect to the improved graphics and gameplay in the remakes. Additionally in FireRed and LeafGreen, a chain of islands known as the [[Sevii Islands]], located far south of mainland Kanto, are unlocked throughout the {{player}}'s quest, with the first three accessible once Blaine is defeated on Cinnabar Island. Becoming the [[Pokémon Champion]] and getting the [[National Pokédex]] unlocks the other islands which make up this archipelago.

In the Generation II games as well as {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, Trainers may travel from Johto to Kanto and notice that changes have occurred as a result of three years having passed since the time of the Generation I games and {{2v2|FireRed|LeafGreen}}:

* The Safari Zone has closed as a result of [[Baoba|the warden]] taking a trip. In Generation II, it is simply inaccessible during normal gameplay while it has been relocated to Johto in Generation IV, with the original area now housing a [[Pal Park]].
* [[Cerulean Cave]], also known as "Unknown Dungeon" has collapsed in [[Generation II]], but in [[Generation IV]], however, it has re-excavated.
* Cinnabar Island has been destroyed by an eruption of the volcano, and its Gym has been relocated to the Seafoam Islands.
* In Generation II only, Viridian Forest became drastically smaller and was a part of [[Kanto Route 2|Route 2]].
* Mt. Moon has greatly decreased in size due to rock slides.
* The Power Plant has become functional.
* The Pokémon Tower has become a radio tower. The Pokémon graves it housed have been moved to the [[House of Memories]].
* Blue has taken over Viridian Gym since Giovanni's retreat for training and remodeled the Gym to suit his tastes.
* Janine has taken over Fuchsia Gym since her father Koga has been promoted to the [[Elite Four]].
* In Generation II only, the Pewter Museum of Science is closed for renovations.
* The southern portion of {{rt|23|Kanto}} was removed in Generation II, and the stone maze that was in the northern portion is gone, leaving a simple, straight path. In Generation IV, though this same northern portion exists, it is labeled as a part of [[Indigo Plateau]], meaning that Route 23 no longer exists.
* The Badge checks have been combined into the Pokémon League Reception Gate, instead of being scattered along Route 23.

==Trivia==
[[File:Kanto - Gen I manual.png|thumb|250px|World Map ([[Generation I]] game manuals)]]
[[File:GenI JA Kanto Town Map Reference.png|thumb|"A map of the Kanto region!<br>I hope she gives it to me..."]]
* There is a map of Kanto with the title "World Map" (with no mention of the name "Kanto") in the English manuals of the [[Generation I]] games.
* Until the release of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Kanto's name was seen only once in the Japanese [[Generation I]] games: upon viewing the [[Town Map]] at {{ga|Blue}}'s house. It was never mentioned in the Generation I games outside of Japan, and thus, many fans assumed the [[region]] was called "Indigo", based on the [[Indigo Plateau]]'s name. By the time the [[Generation III]] remakes, {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, were released, Kanto's name was firmly established and appeared regularly in-game.
* Until the release of {{game|Platinum}}, after Ash defeated [[Maylene]] and [[Crasher Wake]] (not to mention just before Ash challenges [[Fantina]]), Kanto was the only region in the {{pkmn|animated series}} where Ash defeated the [[Gym Leader]]s in a different order from the games.
** It is also the only region thus far to feature [[Battle Frontier (Generation III)|an element]] that was actually in a different region from its location in the games.
* Kanto has certain traits that generally separates it from other [[region]]s:
** It is the only region in the [[Pokémon world]] that shares its name with {{wp|Kantō region|the real-world region}} it was based on.
** It is also the only region where the [[Pokémon League]] is located to the west of every Gym.
** Kanto and [[Johto]] are the only regions that are connected to each other by land.
** Kanto is the only region without a city with a population of at least 100.
* In [[Generation I]], Kanto was slightly redesigned twice after its initial appearance: signposts, doors, and other minor details, along with certain locations, such as [[Cerulean Cave]], were changed between {{game3|Red and Green|Pocket Monsters Red and Green|s}} and [[Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese)|Pocket Monsters Blue]], and then again between Pocket Monsters Blue and {{game3|Yellow|Pocket Monsters Pikachu}}. The international {{game|Red and Blue|s}} reused the tilesets and other graphics from Pocket Monsters Blue, while international {{game|Yellow}} featured the same design as its original Japanese release.
** However, it would be the original design from {{game3|Red and Green|Pocket Monsters Red and Green|s}} that was ultimately reused in Kanto's [[Generation II]] and [[Generation III]] appearances.
* Kanto has appeared in the most games and [[generation]]s to date, having appeared in twelve games (thirteen in Japan<!--Calculations for Gen I are frequently mistaken - it is NOT 14 and 15 up to Gen VII-->) over the course of five generations.
** {{game3|Red and Green|Pocket Monsters Red and Green|s}}, [[Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese)|Pocket Monsters Blue]], {{game|Red and Blue|s}}, and {{game|Yellow}} in [[Generation I]];
** {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}} in [[Generation II]];
** {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} in [[Generation III]];
** {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} in [[Generation IV]];
** [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]] in [[Generation VII]].
* Kanto is briefly mentioned in {{DetPikMov}} during the narration that [[Dr. Ann Laurent]] did during the creation of {{OBP|Mewtwo|Detective Pikachu}}.
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Kanto is "Kantonian", as seen in multiple sources, such as the [[Kantonian Gym]], and dialogue in [[Pokémon Sword and Shield]].

The '''Paldea''' region (Japanese: '''パルデア{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Paldea {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]], and the ninth [[core series]] region to be introduced. It is the setting of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}'s base game, though players leave Paldea and go to [[Kitakami]] and the [[Unova]] region's [[Blueberry Academy]] during [[The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero]].

==Etymology and design concept==
===Etymology===
Paldea may be derived from ''pal'' (friend or ally) or ''paideia'' (education or learning) and ''aldea'', the Spanish word for village or hamlet.

[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world-Europe.png|thumb|left|250px|The map of Europe showing the Paldea region as the {{wp|Iberian Peninsula}}.]]
Paldea is based on the {{wp|Iberian Peninsula}} — which comprises {{wp|Spain}}, {{wp|Portugal}}, and {{wp|Andorra}} — and its shared culture and fauna. It draws inspiration primarily from the {{wp|culture of Spain}}, as can be seen in its {{wp|Culture of Spain#Architecture|architecture}}, {{wp|Spanish cuisine|gastronomy}}, {{wp|Music of Spain|musical influences}}, Pokémon nomenclature, as well as the sporadic use of the {{wp|Spanish language}} by the locals of Paldea. Specific references to Portugal, its {{wp|Culture of Portugal#Architecture|architecture}} and {{wp|Portuguese language|language}} can also be found mainly on western locations of Paldea.

==History==
===Dated history===
{{spoilers}}
* c. 2,000,000 years prior to the events of {{G|Scarlet and Violet}}:
** The [[Area Zero Underdepths]] were formed by seismic shifts.
** Many {{p|Terapagos}} are said to have supposedly gone extinct due to said seismic shifts, with only {{ga|Terapagos|one known survivor}}.
* c. 1,000,000 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the [[Great Crater of Paldea]] was formed.
* c. 2,000 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet:
** The Paldean Empire began to rule Paldea.
** The emperor ushered in the Great Age of Exploration by sending expeditions into the Great Crater of Paldea to find the {{ga|Terapagos|treasure}} rumored to lie inside [[Area Zero]].
* c. 1,000 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the Paldean Empire fell into decline due to the expense of supporting countless failed Area Zero expeditions.
* 805 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, [[Naranja Academy]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Uva Academy]]{{sup/9|V}} was founded in [[Mesagoza]].
* c. 800 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the Paldean Empire unified with its neighboring countries, establishing the modern Paldea region.
* 200 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet:
** The Area Zero Expedition claimed to have become the first exploration team to reach the bottom of Area Zero. Team member [[Heath]], a famed author and natural historian, published his account of the expedition as the [[Scarlet Book]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Violet Book]]{{sup/9|V}}. The book's contents proved to be so fantastical that Heath and the rest of the Area Zero Expedition were accused of lying and widely discredited.
** The Area Zero Expedition planted [[Herba Mystica]], a plant they discovered in Area Zero, in five sites around Paldea in an attempt to cultivate it. They abandoned the project when local Pokémon consumed the Herba Mystica and grew into fearsome [[Titan Pokémon|Titans]].
* c. 140 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, {{Tera}}stallized Pokémon were discovered for the first time in Area Zero.
* 87 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, a research facility was constructed in Area Zero.
* c. 10 years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, [[Professor Sada]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Professor Turo]]{{sup/9|V}} discovered that the energy emitted by the crystals in Area Zero causes the Terastal phenomenon. The Professor proceeded to invent the [[Tera Orb]] technology, sharing it with the Pokémon League and the Academy.
* c. One and a half years prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet:
** [[Nemona]] passed the [[Paldea League]]'s Champion Assessment and became the youngest person in Paldean history to achieve Champion Rank.
** [[Team Star]] confronted their bullies at Naranja Academy{{sup/9|S}}/Uva Academy{{sup/9|V}} in a clash that caused a scandal for the school. Team Star's leader, [[Cassiopeia]], secretly came forward and accepted full blame for the incident. Recognizing the bullying problem as a failure of his administration, Director [[Harrington]] gave Cassiopeia a lenient punishment and then resigned along with all other teaching staff at the time. Cassiopeia temporarily returned to their homeland to continue their studies. The other members of Team Star, unaware of why their boss ceased communicating with them, stopped attending classes and maintained the organization while they waited for their boss's return.
** [[Clavell]] and his assistant [[Jacq]] left their jobs as researchers to work for Naranja Academy{{sup/9|S}}/Uva Academy{{sup/9|V}}. Clavell became the academy's director, and Jacq became a biology teacher.
** [[Tyme]] retired as the {{type|Rock}} [[Gym Leader]] of [[Montenevera]] to work as a mathematics teacher at Naranja Academy{{sup/9|S}}/Uva Academy{{sup/9|V}}. {{type|Ghost}} specialist [[Ryme]] succeeded her sister as Montenevera's Gym Leader.
* c. One year prior to the events of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Professor Sada{{sup/9|S}}/Professor Turo{{sup/9|V}}, along with an AI-operated android made in their likeness, created a fully functioning [[time machine]] with the intention of [[Time travel|bringing]] Pokémon from the past{{sup/9|S}}/future{{sup/9|V}} to Area Zero with the intent of creating a special ecosystem there. However, an incident occurred when two of the retrieved Pokémon, a pair of {{p|Koraidon}}{{sup/9|S}}/{{p|Miraidon}}{{sup/9|V}}, got into a territorial struggle that resulted in the Professor's death. This led the robot duplicate to realize that, should the now-dubbed [[Paradox Pokémon]] escape into the outside world, they would pose a threat to everything around them and began searching for potential candidates from Naranja Academy{{sup/9|S}}/Uva Academy{{sup/9|V}}, including the Professor's estranged son [[Arven]], to take part in a hasty mission to shut down the time machine before more dangerous Paradox Pokémon come through.

===Undated history===
* In a time way before the Paldean Empire's formation, symbols were drawn on the ground, while a large steel plate with more symbols on it is left underground, these can be found at the bottom of [[Area Zero]], their origin is completely unknown.
* During the time of the Paldea empire, forts and watchtowers were built to watch on its neighboring countries during times of war.
* At some point, a merchant from the east travelled to Paldea and sold to the Paldean king, four treasure from a faraway land; a vessel, a broken sword, a set of wooden tablets and a set of beads. These [[Treasures of Ruin|four treasures]] were in reality Pokémon, which, due to the king's greed, were awakened and went berserk, causing a disaster that almost destroyed the kingdom.
* At some point, after the treasures' awakening, the Paldean king called out powerful Pokémon wielders that managed to defeat each of them and then seal them away in shrines across Paldea.

* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Paldea is "Paldean", as seen in the term "Paldean form".
* This is the first region since [[Kanto]] to lack a [[battle facility]].
* This is the only region to have introduced at least one notable [[type expert]] for every type.
** This is also the only region to have a [[Badge]] for every single type.
* Not counting [[Hisui]], which is the former name of a region with numbered routes, this is the first region not to have any traditionally numbered routes.

The '''Sinnoh''' region (Japanese: '''シンオウ{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Sinnoh {{tt|region|chihō}}''), formerly known as '''[[Hisui]]''' (Japanese: '''ヒスイ{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Hisui {{tt|region|chihō}}''), is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. It is located north of [[Kanto]],<ref name="Sinnoh Sound"/> [[Johto]],<ref name="Sinnoh Sound"/> and [[Hoenn]].<ref name="AG187"/> It is the setting of {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s|Pokémon Diamond, Pearl}}, {{game|Platinum||Platinum}}, [[Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl]], and {{pkmn|Legends: Arceus}}; the latter explores the region's earlier history when it was still known as Hisui. It was the fourth [[core series]] region to be introduced.

Sinnoh is composed of the large mainland, the [[Battle Zone]] on another landmass to the northeast, and several smaller islands on both sides of the [[region]]. Most of Sinnoh's routes are on land, having very few water routes, in vast contrast to Hoenn. The region is divided by [[Mount Coronet]], roughly comparable to how the continent that Kanto and Johto make up is essentially a contiguous region.

==Etymology and design concept==
===Etymology===
[[Junichi Masuda]] has stated that Sinnoh's name is derived from "神奥" ("mysterious and profound"),<ref>[https://lineblog.me/masudajunichi/archives/7586253.html Junichi Masuda's Official Blog: Happy 10th Anniversary to Pokémon Diamond and pearl!]<sub>(Japanese)</sub></ref> possibly in reference to the [[Sinnoh myths|various myths]] of the region.

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Sinnoh|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Sinnoh}}
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world.png|thumb|left|200px|The map of Japan showing the Sinnoh region as the island of {{wp|Hokkaido}}.]]
The geography of the Sinnoh region is [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world|based on]] the geography of the Japanese island of {{wp|Hokkaido}} and the southern part of the Russian island {{wp|Sakhalin}}, as well as {{wp|Kunashir}}, which is claimed by Japan, but administered by Russia. Sinnoh has been said to be an island like Hoenn, rather than a peninsula.

Most of the cities and towns in Sinnoh are based on and positioned in the same way as the real cities and towns of Hokkaido. [[Jubilife City]] is Sinnoh's largest city, which is based on {{wp|Sapporo}}, Hokkaido's largest city, while [[Veilstone City]] is based upon {{wp|Abashiri}}, a major port city. The geographical features of Sinnoh are similar as well, with the large mountain ranges of [[Mount Coronet]] resembling the {{wp|Ezo}} mountain chain, which is made up of the {{wp|Teshio Mountains}}, the {{wp|Kitami Mountains}}, the {{wp|Ishikari Mountains}}, the {{wp|Yubari Mountains}}, and the {{wp|Hidaka Mountains}}. The three lakes of Sinnoh mimic {{wp|Lake Toya|Lake Tōya}}, {{wp|Lake Kussharo}} and {{wp|Lake Kutcharo}}. The [[Sendoff Spring|fourth lake of Sinnoh]] is similar to {{wp|Lake Mashu|Lake Mashū}}, which is also known as a mysterious spot that has a dense layer of fog hiding the surface most of the time.

The numbering of the routes in the Pokémon world may also be a reference to Japan's own national route system, which goes from {{wp|Japan National Route 1|1}} to {{wp|Japan National Route 58|58}}, then skips directly to {{wp|Japan National Route 101|101}}, and then skips several more numbers. Routes in Sinnoh do not run concurrent to routes in Hokkaido; instead starting over after the set of routes in Hoenn.

==History==
{{main|Hisui#History|Hisui → History}}

===Dated history===
[[File:Dialga-Palkia-Giratina.png|thumb|250px|Palkia, Giratina, and Dialga on the Spear Pillar.]]
* At most 300 years prior to [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions|Pokémon Diamond, Pearl]], [[Pokémon Platinum Version|Platinum]], [[Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl]], the region was known as [[Hisui]].

===Undated history===
* At the beginning of the [[Pokémon universe]]:
** According to several [[Sinnoh myths|myths]], after creating the [[Pokémon of Myth]], the [[Pokémon universe]], and the [[Lake guardians]], {{Ga|Arceus}} created [[Mount Coronet]], then the [[Hisui]] [[region]], and then the [[Pokémon world]], which makes Sinnoh/Hisui the first region to exist in the world.
** Arceus created the [[Adamant Crystal]], the [[Lustrous Globe]], and [[Griseous Core]]. 
** Arceus fell into a deep sleep within [[Dimension#Arceus's realm|its realm]].
* [[Stark Mountain]] was created and {{p|Heatran}} was formed in lava within it.
* At some point, {{P|Uxie}}, {{P|Mesprit}}, and {{P|Azelf}} dove into the caves at the bottom of the three lakes of Sinnoh: [[Lake Verity]], [[Lake Valor]], and [[Lake Acuity]], respectively, gaining the name "[[lake guardians]]".
* Hisui was eventually renamed to Sinnoh based on the name Arceus was known as by the [[Celestica people|native people]].
* According to the townspeople, [[Floaroma Town]] was once a barren and desolate hill. People started planting flowers around it to cheer up the place, but nothing would grow. Then, someone expressed thanks for a blessing of nature, and the whole hill burst into bloom. It is theorized that {{p|Shaymin}} was the cause of the sudden burst of flowers, given it being the Gratitude Pokémon, and its ability to "instantly transform ruined land into a lush field of flowers," according to its [[Pokédex]] entry.

===Contemporary history===
{{spoilers}}
The contemporary history of Sinnoh changes based on the title of the game being played

===={{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}} and {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}====
{{ga|Lucas}}/{{ga|Dawn}} and their [[friend]] {{ga|Barry}}, leave [[Twinleaf Town]] in an attempt to see a Pokémon similar to that of the [[Red Gyarados]] in the nearby [[Lake Verity]]. At the lake they encounter [[Professor Rowan]] and their [[Professor's assistant]], Dawn/Lucas who end up leaving their briefcase in the grass. The player and Barry get attacked by a group of [[wild Pokémon|wild]] {{p|Starly}} and open the briefcase left behind, giving them access to their [[first partner Pokémon]]. Barry and the player return to Twinleaf Town and set out the next day to return the Pokémon that they had borrowed to Professor Rowan who lives in the neighboring [[Sandgem Town]]. Professor Rowan gives them not only a [[Pokédex]] but also the Pokémon they had borrowed, allowing the two, and Dawn/Lucas to set out on a journey across Sinnoh. The player and their friend, now [[rival]], take on the Sinnoh's eight [[Gym]]s in attempt to become the {{pkmn|Champion}}. Along the way, the player comes across the [[villainous team|villainous]] [[Team Galactic]], who pursues to steal Pokémon and resources in order to complete [[Cyrus]]'s goal of creating a new world in his image. In multiple conflicts with the organization and obtaining their seventh gym badge, the player defeats [[Saturn]] in [[Veilstone City]] who has captured the [[Lake guardians]] and created a [[Red Chain]]. They follow Cyrus up to the peak of [[Mount Coronet]] where the [[Spear Pillar]] lies. Cyrus summons the [[Legendary Pokémon]] of {{p|Dialga}}{{sup/4|D}}{{sup/8|BD}}/{{p|Palkia}}{{sup/4|P}}{{sup/8|SP}}, who can distort time and space respectively, allowing him to recreate the world via usage of the Red Chain that Saturn had made in Veilstone. The player and Barry defeat the evil organization, with most of the group disbanding after Cyrus leaves. The player then leaves for [[Sunyshore City]] and eventually the {{si|Pokémon League}} where they defeat [[Cynthia]] and claim the title of champion.

After finding every Pokémon in Sinnoh's regional Pokédex and becoming champion, the player is contacted by Barry who they go with on a ship to the [[Battle Zone]], home of the {{si|Battle Park}}. On this island, they explore the volcanic [[Stark Mountain]] after some Team Galactic members attempt to take the [[Magma Stone]]. With the help of [[Buck]], they defeat the villains once again and bring peace to the location.

===={{game|Platinum}}====
Platinum's contemporary history is slightly different from that of Diamond and Pearl.

{{ga|Lucas}}/{{ga|Dawn}} and their [[friend]] {{ga|Barry}}, leave [[Twinleaf Town]] in order to find some wild Pokémon. At {{rt|201|Sinnoh}} they are stopped by [[Professor Rowan]] and their [[Professor's assistant]], {{ga|Dawn}} or {{ga|Lucas}}, who provides them with their [[first partner Pokémon]]. They go to Sandgem Town in order to learn more about Pokémon and taking a journey across Sinnoh, but not stop back home first and tell their [[Johanna|mother]] about the road ahead. At [[Lake Verity]] the player meets [[Cyrus]]. The player and their friend, now [[rival]], take on the Sinnoh's eight [[Gym]]s in attempt to become a {{pkmn|Champion}}. Over the course of their journey they meet a Trainer named [[Cynthia]] and a member of the [[International Police]], [[Looker]], who become helpful allies against the [[villainous team|villainous]] [[Team Galactic]], a group  oddly dressed people who pursue the stealing of Pokémon and resources in order to complete Cyrus's goal of creating a new world in his image. In multiple conflicts with the organization and obtaining their seventh gym badge, the player defeats [[Saturn]] in [[Veilstone City]], who has captured the [[lake guardians]] and created a [[Red Chain]]. They follow Cyrus up to the peak of [[Mount Coronet]] where the [[Spear Pillar]] lies. The player, Barry and Cynthia all cooperate to help defeat [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]] only for Cyrus to succeed in summoning both Dialga and Palkia with usage of the Red Chain, bending and warping the world to his desires. The three lake guardians and {{p|Giratina}} suddenly appear and pull Cyrus into the [[Distortion World]], Giratina's world. The player and Cynthia follow into the portal and stop Cyrus from attempting to cause further harm. Cyrus disappears after defeat, with most of the group disbanding. The player then leaves for [[Sunyshore City]] and eventually the {{si|Pokémon League}}, where they defeat the current Champion, Cynthia, and become the new Champion.

After finding every Pokémon in Sinnoh's regional Pokédex and becoming champion, the player is contacted by Barry who they go with on a ship to the [[Battle Zone]], home of the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|IV}}. On this island, the player explores the volcanic [[Stark Mountain]] with [[Buck]]. The two encounter Mars, Jupiter, and [[Charon]] from Team Galactic who are attempting to take the [[Magma Stone]]. With the help of Looker, they defeat the villains once again and bring peace to the location.

==Geography==
===Environment===
[[File:Sinnoh DP artwork alt.png|thumb|290px|Oblique view of the Sinnoh region from above.]]
Sinnoh features a broad range of new and classic environments for the player to explore including, for the first time in a Pokémon RPG, snowy routes. Its terrain is varied: some parts of the region are dry and mountainous; others are wet and swampy. The region is rich in water.

Due to its large size, the main region of Sinnoh can be broken into two sub-regions divided by [[Mount Coronet]], roughly comparable to how the continent that [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]] make up is essentially a contiguous region. Due to this, {{p|Shellos}} and {{p|Gastrodon}} have developed an instance of regional {{wp|speciation}}, with members of the species found on the eastern side being blue-colored and members on the western side being pink-colored.

[[File:Torn World.png|thumb|left|250px|Mount Coronet's peak, with the entrance to the [[Distortion World]] above it, from the northwest.]]
The western half of Sinnoh features a variety of landscapes. Its coasts are notably more rocky than the eastern half, however, the land is far more fertile, and the towns, for the most part, are rural. A windswept canyon, carved out by a river that flows from Mount Coronet, is home to the [[Valley Windworks]], which provides clean, wind-driven electricity to the nearby towns. This is not to say, however, that there is no importance to west Sinnoh, as [[Oreburgh City]], [[Eterna City]], and [[Canalave City]] are the locations of [[Gym|Pokémon Gyms]], and [[Jubilife City]], at the heart of the area, is the most technologically advanced city in the region.

Sinnoh's eastern half is home to a vast many more things, including [[Pokémon Super Contest]]s in [[Hearthome City]], a [[Veilstone Department Store|Department Store]] in [[Veilstone City]], the [[Great Marsh]] of [[Pastoria City]], and the awe-inspiring [[Vista Lighthouse]] of [[Sunyshore City]]. In each of these cities, as well, there is a Pokémon Gym, which is very important for League-bound {{pkmn|Trainer}}s.

Unlike the halves of Sinnoh divided longitudinally by Mount Coronet, the northern area is sparsely populated, with [[Snowpoint City]] as the only major area. This is likely due to the cold climate and snowy terrain in the area. Despite this relative isolation, however, Snowpoint has a Pokémon Gym, making it another important stop for Trainers who wish to compete in the Pokémon League.

A third sub-region is the [[Battle Zone]], which is on a large island to the northeast of the mainland. Much like how people from the [[Sevii Islands]] seem to consider their home to be a separate region from [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]], people from the Battle Zone often refer to Sinnoh as a separate region. Several islands, including [[Newmoon Island]], [[Fullmoon Island]], and [[Iron Island]], lie off the northwestern coast of Sinnoh as well, though these are far eclipsed in both size and importance by the mainland.

Separated from both the Battle Zone and the mainland of Sinnoh by several straits is the island on which the {{si|Pokémon League}} of Sinnoh is located, the only access to which is by way of {{rt|223|Sinnoh}}. It is here where Sinnoh's {{si|Victory Road}} is located, which, unlike previous incarnations has not two, but three entrances: one of these, of course, is the southern entrance that Trainers from the mainland must navigate from, a second is the one that leads to the area in which the [[Elite Four]] can be challenged, and the third leads from a {{m|Defog|foggy}} area of Victory Road to {{rt|224|Sinnoh}}, which is said to be a miniature version of Sinnoh. North from Route 224, the [[Seabreak Path]] leads to {{p|Shaymin}}'s domain, the [[Flower Paradise]].

===Climate===
The climate of Sinnoh varies widely, and most of the region is made of mountainous or hilly areas. Unlike [[Hoenn]], which is located in the south where the climate is warmer, Sinnoh is located on the northern boundaries of the world where the temperature is cooler. It is so cold in the northern part of the region that snow falls constantly. The harsh snow that blows down from the mountain's peaks not only makes the area very cold, but makes the {{rt|217|Sinnoh|routes in the area}} perilous to travel on. Cities such as [[Snowpoint City]] are completely covered in snow, and Pokémon who live nearby have had to adapt to the climate. Recently, the southern side of the region has also become cooler; climate change is taking a toll. Areas such as [[Twinleaf Town]] and {{rt|201|Sinnoh}} now have small amounts of snow on the ground.

[[File:Sinnoh from the sky.png|thumb|250px|A part of the Sinnoh region where the city meets the sea]]
However, not all of the northern areas of Sinnoh are covered in snow. Due to the dry environments and mountainous areas such as [[Stark Mountain]], the small island known as the [[Battle Zone]] is subject to warmer climates. A constant sandstorm rages on {{rt|228|Sinnoh}} due to the flow of wind down though the mountains. Some of the southern areas of the Battle Zone are very tropical and contain dense jungles.

The mainland features full land geography, with only five [[water route]]s. Despite this lack of water routes, in contrast to the [[Hoenn]] region, Sinnoh is known to be rich in water. Rivers that originate from the highlands and mountains in the center of the landmass runs through the region passing many cities, towns, and routes and into the ocean. There are many lakes throughout the region such as [[Lake Acuity]], [[Lake Valor]], and [[Lake Verity]]. All these factors create a tropical climate throughout the mainland. Many large cities settle on or close to the seaside; some of them have large ports.

Further inland, there are many different climates. Due to the mountain zones, different inland areas are subject to rain. This rain creates wetlands. Such areas may also be covered partially or completely by shallow pools of water. The soil in the wetland area is permanently saturated with moisture, which creates swamps, marshes, and bogs. In fact, [[Pastoria City]] was founded on marshy soils that attracted wild Pokémon. Unlike other regions, Sinnoh is sometimes troubled by fog. {{rt|210|Sinnoh}} is often covered in a thick cloud that makes obstacles and Trainers difficult to see; fortunately for travelers, {{m|Defog|this can be easily cleared}}.

===Energy sources===
The Sinnoh region is famed for its energy production and conservation via natural resources. Different areas of Sinnoh use different sources of energy for the use of power generation, heating, and transport fuels. The [[Oreburgh Mine]] is one of the main features in Oreburgh City, as well as the city's leading energy source. Its energy is exported to many parts of the region, including its neighbor, [[Jubilife City]], whose large population consumes a lot of energy. The mine is the livelihood of the town. Vents in the town allow steam to escape and fresh air to enter the mine, likely also clearing the mine of any poison gas (which is historically the bane of coal miners). The mine is operated with the utmost care to avoid causing damage to the natural habitats of wild Pokémon. The system of taking coal out of the mine is automated.

Another local energy source is the [[Valley Windworks]]. The Valley Windworks is a large wind farm situated in a windy valley close to Mount Coronet, so as to generate as much electricity as possible. It is located just off {{rt|205|Sinnoh}}, a short walk east from Floaroma Town. In the area, there are eight tall wind turbines which generate energy that is in turn processed by the power plant in the center of the area. Many towns benefit from the natural renewable energy including [[Floaroma Town]], and [[Eterna City]].

The third and final renewable energy source Sinnoh has to offer is [[Sunyshore City]]'s solar panels, which are ingeniously designed for the use of power and transportation. Because the city is on the coast and gets hit by a lot of sunlight, the solar panels were built to collect energy for little cost, no pollution, and convenience to the city's citizens. It was also built due to the lack of space. However, there is a disadvantage: the solar panel system is often broken, and the city will experience massive blackouts at times. Citizens of and visitors to the city are able to walk around the city on top of the solar panels.

===Demographics===
The Sinnoh region's towns, cities and other areas have a total population of 704 in {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}} and 755 in {{game|Platinum}}. Upon its introduction in [[Generation IV]], it was the largest region by population, and is currently the {{tt|fourth|While Galar has a larger population than Sinnoh's Diamond & Pearl population, Sinnoh's Platinum population is larger than Galar's.}} largest region by population.

===Notable locations===
Sinnoh has fourteen [[List of cities and towns|cities and towns]], as well as three "areas", and a {{si|Pokémon League}}. These sites act as settlements for people to live and work in a functioning society. The [[Fight Area]], the [[Survival Area]] and the [[Resort Area]] all act as towns, however, they appear to be more of a tourist destination and are not considered cities or towns. These three "areas" are located off Sinnoh's mainland and on the [[Battle Zone]], which is considered a sub-region of Sinnoh and is implied by some living on the island as a different region altogether, not unlike how the [[Sevii Islands]] are considered a separate region from [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]]. Thus, Sinnoh has a total of eighteen settlements all over Sinnoh.

The Sinnoh region has 30 different [[route]]s, which are passages permitting Trainers to travel from one location to the next with relative ease. Much like [[Hoenn]] before it, Sinnoh's routes are numbered so that they don't follow sequence directly from previously-known regions' routes. Routes in Sinnoh are numbered from {{rtn|201|Sinnoh}} to {{rtn|230|Sinnoh}}. Compared to previous generations, there aren't many water routes; there are many land routes and mountains. There are also several routes with differing [[weather]]. Some of Sinnoh's routes have snow covering them. Another quirk about the routes in Sinnoh is that some of them do not go directly east/west or north/south, but actually turn before reaching their destination, most notably {{rt|212|Sinnoh}} and {{rt|210|Sinnoh}}, which both have two limbs of equal length.

Although it has few [[water route]]s, Sinnoh is known to be rich in water, and has three lakes at the northernmost ([[Lake Acuity|Acuity]]), easternmost ([[Lake Valor|Valor]]), and westernmost ([[Lake Verity|Verity]]) ends of the main continent. These are home to the [[lake guardians]]. Near Lake Valor there is a hidden fourth lake, [[Sendoff Spring]], which houses [[Turnback Cave]]. Some other significant locations that Sinnoh offers include [[Mount Coronet]], the highest mountain in the Sinnoh region and part of a long mountain range that divides the region in half; the [[Eterna Forest]], a large and mysterious forest; and the [[Great Marsh]], a popular habitat for Pokémon and a [[Safari Zone]] for many Trainers.

In {{aniseries|PTS}}, the Sinnoh region is far enough away to require going from Kanto to Sinnoh by either ship (as {{Ash}}, {{AP|Pikachu}}, and {{AP|Aipom}} did), or by truck (as evidenced by how {{an|Brock}} arrived in the region).

====Landmarks====
[[File:Mt. Coronet.png|left|thumb|200px|[[Mount Coronet]] range, which divides the region into two parts]]
Sinnoh is home to many unique landmarks and areas of interest. These come in a range of tourist attractions such as the luxurious [[Hotel Grand Lake]] and the exciting [[Pal Park]], to many natural phenomena such as the four deep, blue lakes and the vast, dense [[Eterna Forest]]. But the central landmark of the Sinnoh region is Mount Coronet. Standing in the middle of Sinnoh and extending from the northern wilderness to the southern tip of the region, Mount Coronet splits Sinnoh into two halves. It is best defined as a mountain range, with its highest peak shrouded in legend, perhaps being the highest mountain in the entire Pokémon world. The Spear Pillar is situated at the highest point, an ancient shrine to Pokémon which is in ruins. Several of its pillars are still standing, all pointing skyward. The legend of the [[Pokémon of Myth]] is deeply connected with the mountain, as is the plot of Team Galactic. A stained glass window in the Foreign Building in Hearthome City depicts the mountain with a bright shine, representing the Spear Pillar and possibly depicting the creation of {{p|Dialga}}, {{p|Palkia}}, and {{p|Giratina}}. Its place in Sinnoh has caused variation in the species of {{p|Shellos}} and {{p|Gastrodon}}, which have different shapes and coloration depending on the side of Sinnoh they are native to.

On the north part of the region in the [[Battle Zone]], there is another mountain range, [[Stark Mountain]], which consists of an active volcano. The volcano rains ash down upon some parts of the Battle Zone. Outside the cavern is a rugged, seemingly indestructible rock mountain that is thickly blanketed by the volcanic ash it spews. Inside the mountain, fissures in spilled and hardened lava form enormous caverns. Another important landmark of Sinnoh is [[Eterna Forest]], a forest home to many Bug- and Grass-type Pokémon. The Eterna Forest has a reputation for being a mysterious place, from the abandoned [[Old Chateau]] to the strange [[Moss Rock]]. The Eterna Forest is a long and complex structure of trees that make it a natural maze, where a lot of people get lost. Eterna Forest has apparently been the location of numerous sightings of [[Team Galactic]], for many unknown reasons.

Another major landmark is the [[Great Marsh]]. The Great Marsh is a giant wetland that is subject to frequent or continuous flood. It houses many different kinds of Pokémon, some of which are unique to this environment. [[Pastoria City]] was settled to protect the area. It has grown naturally over the years and there is now a lookout that affords views of the Great Marsh. An almost sacred area is the trinity of lakes mysteriously situated throughout the region to form the corners of a triangle. [[Lake Verity]], [[Lake Valor]], and [[Lake Acuity]] are tied to the myth of the creation of the Pokémon world, specifically the creation of spirit. The lakes are said to be inhabited by three [[Lake guardians|guardians]]: {{p|Uxie}}, {{p|Mesprit}}, and {{p|Azelf}}. They are meant to represent knowledge, emotion, and willpower, respectively.

[[File:Grand Underground map BDSP.png|thumb|250px|[[Grand Underground]]; a series of tunnels and caves dug out below Sinnoh]]
The [[Underground]]{{sup/4|DPPt}}/[[Grand Underground]]{{sup/8|BDSP}} is a famous attraction to the Sinnoh region, because of the fact that it is not located above the surface of the region, but below in a series of tunnels dug out by people. There are six independent sections of the labyrinth, each accessible from different places in Sinnoh. In terms of vendors and mining treasures, the areas are equivalent. One of the main attractions is the mining game in which rare items can be found. The Grand Underground also contains multiple caves called Pokémon Hideaways, which contain many kinds of Pokémon not found on the surface of Sinnoh.

The Sinnoh region is the only area where an extreme natural phenomenon has occurred; the gateway to another universe has opened due to the actions of {{p|Giratina}}. At first, Giratina uses [[Turnback Cave]], a cave located in the depths of the mysterious and secret fourth lake of Sinnoh, [[Sendoff Spring]], as a portal to the [[Distortion World]]. It is said that Turnback Cave is a weak point between dimensions, and that the ability to travel across to the Distortion World would be possible. The Distortion World is a mysterious place that disobeys the normal laws of physics: time does not flow and spatial relations are irregular, allowing the player to walk and surf on walls in any direction. Trees and rocks can simply grow out of the ground, and then disappear. The only Pokémon known to inhabit the Distortion World is Giratina.

In {{aniseries|PTS}}, the Sinnohan people have been shown to preserve historical knowledge, which include the [[Sinnoh myths|myths and legends]] passed on from generation to generation. The appreciation for the region's rich history has led them to produce a number of monuments and to erect many cultural heritage institutions that have become popular landmarks. Statues dedicated to the Legendary Pokémon Dialga and Palkia can be found inside the {{DL|Lilypad Town|Lilypad Colosseum}} and at the entrance gates to the [[Eterna Historical Museum]], and the [[Celestic Town Historical Research Center]], presided by {{pkmn|Champion}} [[Cynthia]]'s grandmother, [[Professor Carolina]], has staffers working to unveil the mysteries surrounding the region's past. The people living in Sinnoh also recognize the value of community traditions and civic commemorations. Small, local festivals, such as [[Pastoria City]]'s [[Pastoria Croagunk Festival|Croagunk Festival]] and the [[Twinleaf Festival]], are held annually to keep long-standing traditions alive.

==Sinnoh League==
{{main|Sinnoh League}}
[[File:Sinnoh Elite Four.png|thumb|right|250px|The current members of the Elite Four]]
The regional Pokémon League in the Sinnoh region is known as the Sinnoh League. The Sinnoh League is composed of eight [[Gym Leader]]s and four [[Elite Four]] members, along with the {{pkmn|Champion}}. Pokémon Trainers who earn eight [[Badge]]s by defeating the Gym Leaders of the Sinnoh League qualify to challenge the Elite Four located in the {{si|Pokémon League}} building. Gym Leaders are located in different cities and towns, each with their own specialty [[type]]. It is the Gym Leader's job to be the protector of their respective town or city, as they should be the strongest Trainer residing there. Once all Gym Leaders have been defeated, Trainers may face the Elite Four and its Champion. To defeat the Elite Four, all five Trainers must be defeated in succession.
{{-}}
===Gym Leaders===
In {{game|Platinum}}, [[Fantina]] is the third [[Gym Leader]] fought, with the order otherwise remaining the same.

==Trivia==
* If one were to draw lines to connect the three lakes of Sinnoh, they form a big triangle with [[Mount Coronet]] at the center. This is the same formation that {{p|Uxie}}, {{p|Mesprit}}, and {{p|Azelf}} make on the top of the [[Spear Pillar]] with {{p|Dialga}} or {{p|Palkia}} in the middle, as well as the same formation put in areas relating to the [[Sinnoh myths]].
* Only the southern part of the now-Russian island of {{wp|Sakhalin}} is referenced in the [[region]]. In the 1855 {{wp|Treaty of Shimoda}}, Russia and Japan agreed to split the island, with Japan receiving the southern end. While Japan gave Russia full control of Sakhalin in 1875 in exchange for the {{wp|Kuril Islands}}, Japan was again given the southern 2/5ths of the island after the {{wp|Russo-Japanese War}} in 1905 and would retain control until 1945.
* Sinnoh is the only region of the [[core series]] games to not have a notable {{type|Dragon}} [[Type expert|expert]].
* Sinnoh is the first region of the core series games to contain caves with side-facing entrances. In [[Kanto]], [[Johto]], and [[Hoenn]], all cave portals were front-facing.
* Sinnoh has the most locations with [[special magnetic field]]s of all regions, with a total of three: Mount Coronet, [[Spear Pillar]], and [[Hall of Origin]].
* Sinnoh is the only known region to have once been [[Hisui|known by another name earlier in its history]].
* Sinnoh has an [[List of locations by index number in Generation IV|index number location]] programmed into [[Generation IV]] for it, despite the fact that all Sinnoh locations are programmed into the games already. This index location is at #2006, which coincidentally, was the Japanese release of Sinnoh's first games, {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}. This does not happen for the other three regions programmed in (i.e. Kanto is 2003, not 1996; Johto is 2004, not 1999; and Hoenn is 2005, not 2002). This data is unused during normal gameplay (i.e. without hacking); Pokémon from Sinnoh traded to a game taking place in Johto display their normal "met at" area, much like Pokémon from [[Kanto]] do when traded to Emerald.
* In the [[List of alternately colored Pokémon in the animated series#Shiny Pokémon|animated series]], Sinnoh features the most [[Shiny Pokémon]] seen in a region, with a total of seven: {{DL|Austin|Dustox}}, {{p|Metagross}}, [[Narissa#Ditto 2|Ditto]], {{OBP|Legendary beasts|M13|Raikou, Entei, Suicune}}, and {{p|Ariados}}.
* The [[Fiore]] region is confirmed to be somewhat far from the Sinnoh [[region]], since in the in-game Manaphy event, [[Professor Hastings]] suggests sending the {{p|Manaphy}} Egg to Sinnoh as a response to the term "somewhere far away."
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Sinnoh is "Sinnohan", as shown in the description for an assortment of [[Poffin]]s being sold by {{DL|Royal Avenue|Thrifty Megamart}} in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Sun, Moon}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon}}.

The '''Unova''' region (Japanese: '''イッシュ{{tt|地方|ちほう}}''' ''Issyu {{tt|region|chihō}}'') is a [[region]] of the [[Pokémon world]]. It is the setting of {{game|Black and White|s}} and [[Pokémon Black and White Versions 2|Pokémon Black 2 and White 2]], while a school in Unova called [[Blueberry Academy]] was introduced as the setting of [[The Indigo Disk]] [[The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero|expansion]] of [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]]. It was the fifth [[core series]] region to be introduced.

Unova is stated to be far away from [[Kanto]], [[Johto]], [[Hoenn]], and [[Sinnoh]]; the Pokémon which inhabit Unova are diverse and different from those of other regions. According to [[Junichi Masuda]], the geographical and social background for Unova draws inspiration from the {{wp|New York City metropolitan area}}.<ref>[http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=242 Hidden Power of Masuda: Director's Columns]</ref><ref>"This new region was inspired by New York's Manhattan. I visited New York when Diamond and Pearl launched and I had the chance to wander around the town. When I walked through the streets, I saw a lot of different people having festivals and community events—Italian people, French people—they're coming from different countries and coexisting in one community", [[Junichi Masuda]], [[Official Nintendo Magazine]] Issue 65 page 30.</ref> Although it is geographically based on New York City, it draws inspiration for its landmarks from the entire state of New York, which features a mixture of rural locations and urban areas as well as factory towns and industrial complexes. The region also has several cultural references to the country where this state is located, the {{wp|United States of America}}.

==Etymology and design concept==
===Etymology===
Unova's Japanese name, イッシュ ''Issyu'', is derived from the Japanese word for "one variety", '''一種''' ''isshu'', or '''１種類''' ''isshurui''. According to the game director Masuda, this is to express that although the region is diverse in species and race, they are all the same as living creatures when seen from a distance.<ref name=Iwata>Iwata Asks - Pokémon Black and Pokémon White Versions - Page 2 ([https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/ds/pokemon-black-white/0/1/ English], [http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html Japanese])</ref>

The region's English name contains the Spanish word ''uno'' (one),<ref>Hilliard, Kyle (February 27, 2018). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20240301154813/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/12/31/the-history-of-pokemon.aspx The History Of Pokémon]." ''Game Informer'' (Archived on March 1, 2024.)</ref> and possibly also the English word ''united'' (as in the United States) and the Latin words ''unum'' (one) and ''nova'' (new). The name also sounds like parts of the phrase "'''Un'''ited States '''of''' '''A'''merica".

===Design concept===
{{main|Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Unova|Pokémon world in relation to the real world → Unova}}
[[File:Pokemon-to-real-world-North America.png|thumb|left|250px|The map of {{wp|North America}} showing the Unova region as the {{wp|New York metropolitan area}}.]]
Although some of Unova is geographically based on New York, the creators of the region took some liberties in regards to the surrounding areas. One of the largest cities in Unova, [[Castelia City]], is based on {{wp|Lower Manhattan}}, but to the immediate north of Castelia is (as opposed to a continuing metropolis as in real life) a [[Desert Resort|vast desert]]. [[Nimbasa City]], which is to the north of Castelia City, could be a reference to {{wp|Broadway (New York City)|Broadway}}, which is located in Manhattan. [[Nacrene City]], with its restored storehouses, is reminiscent of the ubiquitous lofts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The division of Unova may also be a reference to the {{wp|Borough (New York City)|Boroughs of New York City}}. The [[Skyarrow Bridge]] is a reference to the {{wp|Brooklyn Bridge}}, which connects Brooklyn and Manhattan. The [[Battle Subway]] is a reference to the {{wp|New York City Subway}}, which is the most extensive public transit system in the world, as well as one of the oldest.

==History==
[[File:Unova world map.png|250px|thumb|Location of Unova in the [[Pokémon world]], as seen in {{aniseries|BW}}]]
===Dated history===
* 3,000 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, the {{cat|Relic items}} were created.
* 2,500 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, the [[Relic Castle]] was flourishing and the {{p|Darmanitan}} in front of it went to {{status|sleep}}.
* 200 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, an ultra-rich family purchased and named the [[Liberty Garden]].
* 200 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, [[Village Bridge]] was constructed after the local river burst its banks, flooding the settlement that stood there previously.
* 100 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, the warehouses of [[Nacrene City]] were constructed.
* 100 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, {{p|Klink}} started appearing in [[Chargestone Cave]].
* 50 years prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White, {{p|Elgyem}} was seen for the first time when it appeared from far in the [[desert]].

===Undated history===
* "Thousands of years" prior to the events of Pokémon Black and White:
** In mythology, Unova was created by uniting the warring peoples of the land by [[Heroes of Truth and Ideals|twin heroes]] using [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon#Original Dragon|a single powerful dragon]], which led both to become kings. However, the brothers started to argue over their beliefs; the elder brother sought truth and the younger brother sought ideals. Their arguments somehow split the single dragon into {{p|Reshiram}}, who sided with the older brother, and {{p|Zekrom}}, who sided with the younger brother. Since they were both born from the same dragon neither could defeat the other and the brothers declared that there was no right side. However, eventually their sons continued the fight and both the dragons started to battle again, destroying the Unova region with their {{t|fire}} and {{t|Electric|lightning}}. Reshiram and Zekrom's bodies were destroyed and changed into the [[Light Stone|Light]] and [[Dark Stone|Dark Stones]] respectively.
** Sometime after the original dragon had been split into Reshiram and Zekrom, one of the two brothers and their respective dragon created the Relic Castle, which was the seat of a new civilization for people and Pokémon.
** {{p|Kyurem}} is thought to have appeared around this time, however, there are two conflicting legends that reveal its origins:
*** An old legend in [[Lacunosa Town]] describes Kyurem as an extraterrestrial Pokémon that came to the [[Pokémon world]] within an icy meteor, creating the [[Giant Chasm]]. It's said it'd take people and Pokémon and eat them, which led to the construction of the giant wall surrounding the town.
*** An old legend told by [[Drayden]] describes Kyurem as a third dragon created by the leftovers of the original dragon, lacking truth and ideals after the creation of Reshiram and Zekrom, only capable to retrieve one of them by [[Pokémon fusion|absofusing]] with one of the two dragons through the [[DNA Splicers]].
* At some point in the distant past, a civil war broke out in Unova that caused an intense forest fire. The many Pokémon that lived in the forest became trapped, though luckily the [[Swords of Justice]] came in to save them—{{p|Terrakion}} moved away boulders that blocked their escape route, {{p|Virizion}} used its nimble movements to protect Pokémon from looming flames, and {{p|Cobalion}} led the scared Pokémon out of the forest. These Pokémon would later become responsible for ending the war before disappearing into myths. However, the forest was still burned to the ground in the end, resulting in the trio finding a lone Pokémon; {{p|Keldeo}}, that they decided took in as their own.
* After Keldeo's adoption, it started being taught the knowledge and moves necessary to survive by the Swords of Justice. Over time however, Keldeo began to surpass its teachers and eventually decided to leave the trio, but it is unknown why it left.
* A legend says that in the past, {{p|Thundurus}} and {{p|Tornadus}} once raced across Unova, tearing up the lands with their respective weather-controlling powers, not caring about settlements and creatures in their path. {{p|Landorus}}, seeing the massive destruction the pair had brought to the region and its inhabitants, is said to have punished them so that they would never repeat their actions.
* It's said that {{p|Meloetta}} once entertained the people of Unova with song and dance, but when sorrow filled the hearts of people, Meloetta lost both this melody and its red shoes.

===Contemporary history===
{{spoilers}}
====Pokémon Black and White====
In contemporary history, a present containing three [[first partner Pokémon]]—one each for [[Cheren]], [[Bianca]], and {{ga|Hilda}}/{{ga|Hilbert}}—was sent to Hilda/Hilbert's house in [[Nuvema Town]] by [[Professor Juniper]] on their mothers' request, so that they could each start their Pokémon journeys through the Unova region, challenging each of Unova's eight Gyms in order to collect Badges and eventually reach the {{un|Pokémon League}}. During their travels, Hilda/Hilbert met and battled with the members of [[Team Plasma]] many times, including their king, [[N]], and encountered the mysterious [[Shadow Triad]], with events coming to a head at [[Dragonspiral Tower]], where N managed to awaken and capture {{p|Zekrom}}{{sup/5|B}}/{{p|Reshiram}}{{sup/5|W}}, inviting Hilda/Hilbert to face him after they had beaten the Pokémon League and resurrected Reshiram{{sup/5|B}}/Zekrom{{sup/5|W}} from the [[Light Stone]]{{sup/5|B}}/[[Dark Stone]]{{sup/5|W}}. On retrieving the appropriate stone from [[Nacrene Museum]] and defeating the [[Elite Four]], Hilda/Hilbert reached the Champion's room, where N was waiting for them, having just defeated the [[Pokémon Champion|Champion]] [[Alder]]. N then summoned [[N's Castle|his castle]], which rose out of the earth surrounding the Pokémon League; Team Plasma had been working tirelessly for years prior to build the fortress around the Pokémon League right under their nose, overworking the Pokémon gifted to them by Trainers they had emotionally manipulated into doing so for this purpose. N then invites Hilda/Hilbert into the castle to battle him in order to test the strength of their convictions.

On entering the castle, Hilda/Hilbert are ambushed by all of the [[Seven Sages]] (except [[Ghetsis]]), who planned to defeat them so that their king's reign would be unopposed. Fortunately, Bianca arrived, bringing all the [[Gym Leader]]s of the region that she was able find, which includes all of them except for [[Chili]], [[Cress]], and [[Cilan]], whom Bianca claimed she could not contact in time. The Gym Leaders then opted to engage the Seven Sages in battle on Hilda/Hilbert's behalf, so that they were able to ascend through the castle and defeat N. Eventually, Hilda/Hilbert reached Team Plasma's King in the throne room, where N summoned his member of the Tao trio, who subsequently came crashing through the farthest wall of the room. The presence of Zekrom{{sup/5|B}}/Reshiram{{sup/5|W}} then activated the player's dormant stone, which emerged from the [[Bag]] and transformed into its counterpart, Reshiram{{sup/5|B}}/Zekrom{{sup/5|W}}. The latter then allowed Hilda/Hilbert to attempt to capture them and after doing so, Hilda/Hilbert proceeded to defeat N in the ensuing battle.

N's loss to his opponent caused Ghetsis to storm into the room in rage, insisting that N was a complete failure and a freak and revealing his true motivation for Team Plasma. By separating all other Pokémon from their Trainers, while Team Plasma retained their own, he, as leader of the group (acting through N), would have been left in a position of power from which he could have dominated the world. However, his delusions of grandeur were cut short by his defeat in a final Pokémon battle at the hands of Hilda/Hilbert followed by his arrest. N, however, was not arrested and subsequently flew from the land on Reshiram{{sup/5|W}}/Zekrom{{sup/5|B}} in order to do some soul searching in light of Ghetsis's revelations. He was not seen again in Unova, but there is a rumor that someone with a strong resemblance to N was spotted somewhere in a far-off region. Hilda/Hilbert then continued the rest of their journey, managing to also cover eastern Unova, (becoming the first person to successfully operate the [[Poké Transfer]]), locate and aid in the arrest of the remaining Seven Sages, and eventually return to the League to defeat the Pokémon League Champion Alder themselves. Afterwards, after some time reflecting, Bianca decides to become an assistant to Professor Juniper to aid in her research, and Hilda/Hilbert leaves Unova to search for N.

====Between Pokémon Black and White and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2====
During the two years between the events of Pokémon Black and White and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, construction of [[Unova Route 4|the road]] between [[Castelia City]] and [[Nimbasa City]] through the [[desert]] was either completed and a small settlement was established on this road{{sup/5|B2}}, or abandoned after ancient ruins were discovered in the sand and excavated{{sup/5|W2}}. The [[gate]] between {{rt|4|Unova}} and Nimbasa City was expanded into [[Join Avenue]]. The construction in the south of [[Driftveil City]] was completed, with the [[Pokémon World Tournament]] taking the place of the [[Cold Storage]]. The [[Entralink]]'s moat was drained or dried up, and a different type of Entree now grows in the center. A section was taken out of a [[Reversal Mountain|mountain]] to the east, with [[Lentimas Town]] built in the new space. 

Significant construction occurred in [[Undella Town]], with {{tc|the Riches}} moving away (except for the father) and their house being demolished; in its place, many new villas were built. In this construction effort, the mountain was dug away to the point where construction workers dug an entrance into [[Reversal Mountain]]. In addition, the [[Marine Tube]] was constructed between Undella Town and [[Humilau City]].

Furthermore, {{OBP|Victory Road|Black and White}} has collapsed. As a result, {{rt|10|Unova}} is closed and replaced by another path, {{rt|22|Unova}} and {{rt|23|Unova}}. Also, the entrance to [[Challenger's Cave]] has collapsed.

Additionally, the coastline of Unova has changed between the games.

As revealed via [[Memory Link]], Ghetsis reforms Team Plasma during this period.

====Pokémon Black 2 and White 2====
{{ga|Nate}}/{{ga|Rosa}} receives their first Pokémon from Bianca in their hometown of [[Aspertia City]]. Together with [[Hugh]], who hopes to take back his sister's {{p|Purrloin}} from [[Team Plasma]], the duo takes on the new lineup of Gyms in the Unova region. After Nate/Rosa earns the {{badge|Legend}} from [[Drayden]], Team Plasma attacks [[Opelucid City]], covering the city in unbreakable ice. The [[Shadow Triad]] takes the opportunity to steal the [[DNA Splicers]] from [[Opelucid Gym]]. Nate/Rosa and Hugh chase Team Plasma to [[Humilau City]], where after earning their final badge, the {{badge|Wave}}, they confront [[Zinzolin]], [[Colress]], and the Shadow Triad at the [[Giant Chasm]]. After the Triad releases Hugh's sister's Purrloin, now a {{p|Liepard}}, Hugh tells Nate/Rosa to go ahead and confront Team Plasma's leader, [[Ghetsis]].

Just before Ghetsis freezes Nate/Rosa alive with {{p|Kyurem}}'s {{m|Glaciate}}, [[N]] flies in on {{p|Zekrom}}{{sup/5|B2}}/{{p|Reshiram}}{{sup/5|W2}}, saving them. However, Ghetsis uses Kyurem's power to turn Zekrom{{sup/5|B2}}/Reshiram{{sup/5|W2}} back into an orb, then uses the DNA Splicers to fuse it with Kyurem, turning it into [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Kyurem|Black]]{{sup/5|B2}}/[[List of Pokémon with form differences#Kyurem|White]]{{sup/5|W2}} Kyurem. Nate/Rosa knocks out Kyurem, causing the two {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon to separate, then defeats an enraged Ghetsis. Thankful, N suggests that Nate/Rosa proceed to the {{un|Pokémon League}}. Heeding his words, Nate/Rosa ascend {{OBP|Victory Road|Black 2 and White 2}}, defeats the Elite Four, and emerges victorious in battle with the new {{pkmn|Champion}}, [[Iris]].

After returning home, Hugh's sister thanks the player for helping her big brother, and tells Nate/Rosa that she has been dreaming of a {{p|Zoroark}} calling Nate/Rosa's name. At Hugh's suggestion, Nate/Rosa returns to Victory Road, finding a Zoroark that leads them to the ruins of [[N's Castle]], where N and Reshiram/Zekrom challenge them to battle. After being defeated, N says goodbye to his dragon and releases it by asking it to turn back into an orb to give to Nate/Rosa. Nate/Rosa climbs to the top of [[Dragonspiral Tower]], and faces Zekrom{{sup/5|B2}}/Reshiram{{sup/5|W2}} again, this time, in an attempt to capture it. After this is done, N returns and tells the player that Kyurem has reawakened. With this, Nate/Rosa heads to the Giant Chasm again, catches Kyurem in its normal form, and recovers the lost DNA Splicers.

====Between Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet====
[[Blueberry Academy]] was established by [[Cyrano]], located underwater off the coast of Unova, and formed close ties with the historic [[Naranja Academy]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Uva Academy]]{{sup/9|V}} in [[Paldea]] by becoming its sister school.

====Pokémon Scarlet and Violet====
=====The Teal Mask=====
An annual school trip is held by the two sister schools. Four students of [[Paldea]]'s Naranja Academy{{sup/9|S}}/Uva Academy{{sup/9|V}}, which includes {{ga|Florian}}/{{ga|Juliana}}, and two students of Unova's Blueberry Academy, [[Kieran]] and [[Carmine]], alongside their teacher, [[Briar]], participate in the trip to the siblings's homeland, [[Kitakami]]. After meeting Florian/Juliana and continuously losing to them, and having the [[Legendary Pokémon]] he's long idolized, {{ga|Ogerpon}}, choose them over him, Kieran develops an overwhelming compulsion to become stronger and defeat them. He, Carmine, and Briar return to Blueberry Academy a little early due to developments concerning the [[Great Crater of Paldea]].

=====Between The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk=====
Pushing himself to grow stronger in order to defeat his [[rival]], Kieran conquers the {{DL|Blueberry Academy|BB League}} and becomes Blueberry Academy's new {{pkmn|Champion}} after defeating [[Drayton]], at the cost of skipping sleep and making the atmosphere in the school's [[League Club Room|League Club]] unpleasant for everyone else. Meanwhile, [[Carmine]] assisted [[Briar]] as they travelled to many different [[Region|regions]]. Thanks to her discoveries about {{Tera}}stallization, she installs a giant sphere called Terarium Core in the ceiling of the school's undersea [[Terarium]] dome, enabling the students and staff members to start utilizing the Terastal phenomenon. The photographer [[Perrin]] is also hired to take promotional photos for the academy.

=====The Indigo Disk=====
Florian/Juliana is invited to Blueberry Academy as an exchange student. Drayton, having become a member of the school's [[Elite Four]] after being defeated by Kieran, invites the new exchange student to participate in the BB League, hoping to restore the genuine love Kieran once had for battling. After clearing the four [[Elite Trial]]s and defeating the Elite Four, Florian/Juliana is granted the right to challenge Kieran. They emerge victorious, becoming the new BB League Champion. Although Kieran initially retains his obsession to defeat his rival, a subsequent adventure in Paldea's [[Area Zero Underdepths]] makes him see the error of his ways and become friends with Florian/Juliana once again.

At Blueberry Academy, Florian/Juliana meets Perrin, whom they had previously befriended in Kitakami and who asks for their help in tracking down the [[Paradox Pokémon]] known as {{p|Gouging Fire}}{{sup/9|S}}/{{p|Iron Boulder}}{{sup/9|V}} and {{p|Raging Bolt}}{{sup/9|S}}/{{p|Iron Crown}}{{sup/9|V}} in Paldea's [[Area Zero]] so she can take photos of them.

==Geography==
[[File:Unova PG.png|thumb|250px|Unova in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
Unova is divided by two rivers that lead into an ocean to the south of it. These rivers cannot be surfed on, with the exception of the river directly below [[Village Bridge]]. It divides Unova into central and eastern peninsulas and a western landmass. These three landmasses are connected by five bridges: the [[Skyarrow Bridge]], the [[Driftveil Drawbridge]], the [[Tubeline Bridge]], [[Marvelous Bridge]], and the Village Bridge. The eastern part of Unova is further divided by mountains that makes a southeast part and northeast part. The southeastern part is important to Trainers who want to compete in the Pokémon League since two Gyms are located there, but the northeastern part is not since there are no Gyms there and it mostly has tourism, as evidenced by the amount of people speaking foreign languages. Further away from this bundle of towns is where the {{un|Pokémon League}} is located. Interestingly, the northeastern part is the only place in the region to find Pokémon species foreign to Unova outside of Swarms. The central peninsula of Unova consists of two of the largest cities in the Pokémon world, [[Castelia City]] and [[Nimbasa City]], as well as [[Opelucid City]] further north, all of which contain Gyms. Every bridge in Unova connects to the central part of the region from either the east or west. The western side contains medium-sized towns and more varied landscapes but it also has three Gyms there, making it another destination to visit for any Pokémon Trainer.

Unova is a mixture of urban and rural land. The region features 21 settlements which reflect the diversity of the region. Many cities have buildings that resemble real-world buildings, such as [[Striaton City]] and [[Castelia City]]. However, some cities remain the way buildings in the past do, such as [[Humilau City]], which has mostly wooden buildings on platforms above the ocean. Castelia City, a sprawling metropolis, is one of the largest cities in the Pokémon world. [[Nuvema Town]], which is inhabited by the Pokémon expert [[Professor Juniper]], is smaller and quieter. [[Black City]]{{sup/5|B}}{{sup/5|B2}}, a version-exclusive city. Unova's landscape also features several forests (one of which is also version-exclusive, [[White Forest]]{{sup/5|W}}{{sup/5|W2}}), a [[Desert Resort|desert]], a [[Chargestone Cave|magnetic cave]] and areas where the move {{m|Dive}} can be used outside of battle.

Although Unova appears in some ways more technologically advanced than the previous regions, this development is not spread across the whole of the region, for there are several aesthetic differences in the region depending on the version. In Pokémon White and White 2, these changes make the geography more rural-looking, while in Pokémon Black and Black 2, these changes are more modern or technological in appearance. Locations that fall into the category are [[Opelucid City]], [[Mistralton City]], [[Reversal Mountain]], and [[Unova Route 4|Route 4]]{{sup/5|B2W2}}.

===Climate===
{{main|Season (game mechanic)}}
The climate of Unova, unlike other regions, solely depends on the time of the year.

Unlike previous regions, where climatic change was experienced locally (that is to say, some routes would always feature snow, and some routes would always feature rain), Unova is susceptible to national seasonal change. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each last approximately thirty days, and recur three times each within a year. Each season brings with it different weather patterns, unlocks different events, and presents altered Pokémon availabilities.

===Demographics===
The Unova region has a total population of 949, including all the towns, cities and areas. Upon its introduction in [[Generation V]], it was the largest region by population and is currently the third largest region by population.

=====Bridges and tunnels=====
[[File:Driftveil Drawbridge anime.png|thumb|Driftveil Drawbridge in {{aniseries|BW}}]]
Given that Unova is spread across three strips of land divided by two rivers, a number of bridges and an underwater tunnel exist to allow free movement across the region. Each of them has its own characteristic features and are even popular tourist attractions; they are:
* [[Skyarrow Bridge]]
* [[Driftveil Drawbridge]]
* [[Tubeline Bridge]]
* [[Village Bridge]]
* [[Marvelous Bridge]]
* [[Marine Tube]]{{sup/5|B2W2}}

====Routes====
Unlike previous regions, Unova's routes do not follow the same numbering system, with a jump to 301, but are numbered {{rtn|1|Unova}}-{{rtn|23|Unova}}, paralleling the [[Kanto]] region's numbering system and emphasizing Unova's dissociation from the previous four regions.

In the {{pkmn|animated series}}, it is also far enough away from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh that travelling to or from the region required either via airplane (as Ash and Delia did to arrive in Unova) or by ship (as evidenced by the return journey), the latter also requiring passage through the [[Decolore Islands]] to reach Kanto.

==BB League==
{{main|Blueberry Academy#BB League|Blueberry Academy → BB League}}
[[Blueberry Academy]] has its own unofficial [[Pokémon League]], referred to as the BB League, which is used as a ranking system to determine the strongest Trainer in the school. Unlike the [[Unova League]], this League has no [[Gym Leader]]s. Instead, a Trainer of a high-enough rank may take on an [[Elite Four]] member's Elite Trial, then the Elite Four member themselves, and, if victorious against all four of them, the {{pkmn|Champion}}.

==Trivia==
* Unova is the first [[core series]] [[region]] to be based on a real-world region outside of Japan.
** Unova is also the region that has the most settlements, with 21.
* Unova is the only region without:
** an actual or former {{type|Rock}} [[Gym]] in the generations that introduced Gyms.<!--Do not remove this. It says "actual or FORMER". Jasmine is a former Rock-type Gym Leader, and the Montenevera gym was originally run by Ms. Tyme, a Rock specialist.-->
** a new {{type|Psychic}} specialist, as [[Caitlin]] was introduced in [[Generation IV]], although she could not be battled until Generation V.
** a regional [[Pokédex]] that starts with a {{type|Grass}} [[first partner Pokémon]] (although the Grass-type first partner Pokémon is still entry #001, its Pokédex starts with {{p|Victini}} as #000).
** the [[List of Pokémon by evolutionary line|evolutionary lines]] of {{p|Pikachu}} and/or {{p|Magikarp}} in its regional Pokédex.
** an [[origin mark]].
* Unova is the only main series region which does not use a romanization of the Japanese name as its English name, and the only region whose name is different among all translations of the games.
** According to [[Junichi Masuda]], Unova's Japanese name was translated into different languages of the games so that players who do not speak Japanese can still understand the meaning behind the name.<ref>(February 10, 2011). [https://www.bisafans.de/spiele/editionen/schwarz-weiss/gamefreak2.php Interview with Game Freak in London] by Bisafans (Page 2) (German)</ref> 
* Except [[Black City]] and [[White Forest]], all English names of cities and towns in Unova come from different types of cloud or cloud phenomena. Likewise, except Black City and White Forest, all Japanese names of cities and towns in Unova come from traditional patterns.
* In some pre-release material in {{pmin|the United Kingdom}}, Unova was referred to as '''Alleos'''.
* Unova is tied with [[Galar]] with the most [[Gym Leader]]s in a single region, with 14 in total.
* Unova has the most [[Gym]]s in cities, with all eleven of them. [[Sinnoh]] and [[Kalos]] both also have all of their Gyms in cities, but only have eight Gyms each.
* Unova is the only region in which multiple gyms specialize in the same type: the [[Striaton Gym]] (which also specializes in {{t|Grass}} and {{t|Fire}}) and the [[Humilau Gym]] both specialize in {{t|Water}} types, and the [[Nacrene Gym]] and [[Aspertia Gym]] both specialize in {{t|Normal}} types.
* Unova is the only region to have two [[Victory Road]]s.
* The {{wp|Demonym|adjectival form}} of Unova is "Unovan", as mentioned in {{p|Terrakion}}'s [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Pokémon Shield]] Pokédex entry.
* The northwestern and northeastern portions of Unova are, in-game, incongruous with one another; the western side is larger in the north-south direction than the eastern side.
* Junichi Masuda chose New York as the basis for the Unova region with Pokémon musical concerts in mind; he had his music arranged and performed in Pokémon-themed concerts held in {{wp|Kantō region|Kantō}}, {{wp|Kansai region|Kansai}}, {{wp|Kyushu}}, and {{wp|Hokkaidō}} (the real-life basis for the regions Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh respectively), and he had wanted to hold a similar concert in New York due to the many musical theaters found in Manhattan. Ultimately, the plan never came through due to complications, such as having to fly all the musicians and instruments to the United States.<ref name=Iwata/>
